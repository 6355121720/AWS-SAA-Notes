Here’s **AWS ElastiCache** in **short but deeply structured** form:

## ⚡ AWS ElastiCache — In Short (But In-Depth)

### 🧠 What It Is

* **In-memory caching service** by AWS for ultra-fast data access.
* Supports:

  * **Redis** (feature-rich, pub/sub, TTL, sorted sets, streams, persistence, Lua, etc.)
  * **Memcached** (simple, multi-threaded, no persistence)

---

### 🚀 Why Use It?

* **Sub-millisecond latency** for read/write.
* **Reduces DB load** by caching frequent queries (e.g., session data, product pages).
* Ideal for **real-time applications**: gaming, ad tech, chat apps, dashboards, leaderboards.

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

| Feature           | Redis                           | Memcached                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Persistence       | ✅ Yes (Snapshots, AOF)          | ❌ No persistence             |
| Replication       | ✅ Yes (Multi-AZ, auto failover) | ❌ No built-in replication    |
| Clustering        | ✅ Yes (sharded with slots)      | ✅ Yes (client-side sharding) |
| Pub/Sub & Streams | ✅ Supported                     | ❌ Not supported              |
| Multi-threaded    | ❌ (single-threaded)             | ✅ (multi-threaded)           |
| Backup & Restore  | ✅ Snapshots, automated backups  | ❌ Not available              |
| Security          | IAM, TLS, VPC, KMS, Auth        | VPC only                     |
| Auto Discovery    | ✅ Yes (for clusters)            | ✅ Yes                        |

### 🔄 Use Cases

* ✅ Session storage
* ✅ Caching query/API results
* ✅ Leaderboards / counters / TTL-based data
* ✅ Message queues / pub-sub (Redis)
* ✅ Real-time analytics

---

### 🛠️ Management Features

* **Fully managed** (patching, monitoring, failover handled by AWS)
* Supports **CloudWatch metrics**
* Integrated with **VPC, IAM, KMS, Security Groups**
* **Scaling:** Vertical (instance type), Horizontal (Redis Cluster sharding)

---

### 🧪 Key Limits

* **Redis Max Nodes per Cluster**: 90 (with sharding)
* **Max Data per Node**: \~637 GiB (Redis, varies by instance type)
* **Eviction Policies:** allkeys-lru, volatile-lru, noeviction, etc.

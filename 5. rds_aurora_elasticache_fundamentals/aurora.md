# 📘 Amazon Aurora – Complete In-Depth Notes

---

## 🔹 What is Aurora?

Amazon Aurora is a **fully managed relational database engine** designed by AWS, offering the **speed and availability of high-end commercial databases** (like Oracle) with the **simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases** (like MySQL and PostgreSQL).

It is compatible with:

* ✅ **Aurora MySQL**
* ✅ **Aurora PostgreSQL**

---

## 🧱 Aurora Core Architecture

### 🔸 Compute Layer

* Consists of:

  * **Writer instance** (1 in single-writer mode, up to 5 in multi-writer)
  * **Read replicas** (up to 15)
* These instances are **stateless compute nodes**
* They all interact with a **shared distributed storage layer**

### 🔸 Storage Layer

* **Storage is decoupled** from compute
* Automatically replicated across **6 copies in 3 AZs** (2 per AZ)
* **Auto-healing** and fault-tolerant
* **Auto-scaled up to 128 TB**
* Shared by all instances (writer and readers)

---

## 🔁 Aurora Data Flow Summary

* **Writes:**
  Sent to all 6 storage nodes → Committed after **4/6 ACKs**

* **Reads:**
  Served by **fastest 3 of 6 storage nodes** (quorum read)
  Done by writer or any reader instance

* **Backups:**
  Continuous and automatic via **Aurora storage log**
  **No performance impact**

---

## 🧩 Aurora Writer Modes

### 🔹 Single-Writer Cluster (Default)

* 1 writer + up to 15 readers
* Strong consistency
* **Failover**: Promotes a reader to writer (30–60 sec)
* Simpler and widely used

### 🔹 Multi-Writer Cluster

* Up to **5 writer instances** (Aurora MySQL only)
* Concurrent writes from any writer
* Aurora handles **write conflict resolution**
* Instant failover
* Use case: global apps, mission-critical HA, active-active

## 📈 Aurora Scalability

| Feature           | Limit/Behavior                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Max Storage       | Auto-scales up to **128 TB** per cluster         |
| Max Read Replicas | 15 per cluster                                   |
| Read IOPS         | Millions of reads/sec with shared storage        |
| Write IOPS        | Write limited by writer instance (or 5 in multi) |
| Storage IOPS      | Scales independently of compute                  |

---

## 📦 Backup & Restore

* **Continuous backups** to S3 with point-in-time restore (PITR)
* **Manual snapshots** supported
* Restores are **fast and storage-efficient**
* Zero performance impact (no backup window)

---

## 🔒 Security Features

* VPC integration (no public access unless explicitly allowed)
* **Encryption at rest** with KMS
* **TLS in transit**
* IAM-based authentication (IAM DB auth)
* Audit logging (PostgreSQL)

---

## ⚙️ Performance Features

* Aurora MySQL: Up to **5× faster** than standard MySQL
* Aurora PostgreSQL: Up to **3× faster** than standard PostgreSQL
* **High throughput**, low latency due to:

  * Shared storage layer
  * Read optimization via quorum
  * Network-attached durable storage

---

## ☁️ Aurora Global Database

* Designed for globally distributed apps
* **1 primary region** (read/write)
* Up to **5 secondary regions** (read-only, <1 sec replication lag)
* Use case: disaster recovery, global low-latency reads
* Failover from global replica → promoted to primary in minutes

---

## 🔄 Aurora Serverless

> ✅ Only for **Aurora v1 (MySQL-compatible)** and **Aurora v2 (PostgreSQL & MySQL)**

* **Auto-scaling** database capacity
* Pay-per-use model
* Pauses when idle → resumes on demand
* Ideal for dev/test, unpredictable workloads
* Serverless v2 supports near-instant scaling + multi-AZ

---

## 🧮 Pricing Model

You pay for:

* **Instance hours** (writer + readers)
* **I/O operations** (reads/writes to storage)
* **Backup storage**
* **Snapshots**
* **Data transfer between regions (if global)**

---

## 🔧 Monitoring & Maintenance

* Fully integrated with:

  * **CloudWatch**
  * **Enhanced Monitoring**
  * **Performance Insights**
* Supports:

  * **Automatic minor version upgrades**
  * **Manual major upgrades**
* Automatic failover and repair

## 🆚 Aurora vs Traditional RDS

| Feature            | RDS (MySQL/Postgres)   | Aurora                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Storage            | Per instance           | Shared across all instances |
| Read Replicas      | Up to 5                | Up to 15                    |
| Write Model        | Single writer          | Single or multi-writer      |
| Storage Resilience | No built-in redundancy | 6-way replication           |
| Backup             | Snapshot-based, manual | Continuous PITR             |
| Performance        | Slower (IO-bound)      | Much faster (shared I/O)    |
| Failover Speed     | Minutes                | Seconds                     |
| Global Support     | No                     | Aurora Global DB            |

## ⚠️ Aurora Limitations

* Multi-writer mode: only for Aurora **MySQL**
* Some engine features may lag behind open-source versions
* No read-your-write guarantees in multi-writer (eventual sync)
* Can’t scale down storage once it grows

---

## 🧠 When to Use Aurora

✅ Choose Aurora when:

* You need **high availability, durability, and scalability**
* You want **better performance** than RDS
* You need **up to 15 replicas** and **low-latency reads**
* You want **serverless** or **multi-region** support
* You want to reduce operational complexity

---

Let me know if you want a separate section for:

* Query performance tuning
* Aurora PostgreSQL-specific features
* Aurora Global Database internals (with replication lag behavior, failover logic)

Great question — let’s clarify exactly what is present in **Aurora Global Database’s secondary regions**.

---

## 🌍 Aurora Global Database — Secondary Region Architecture

### ✅ What does a **secondary region** contain?

| Component                  | Present in Secondary Region? | Notes                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read-only DB instances** | ✅ Yes                        | You can launch reader instances to serve traffic in that region.                                           |
| **Writer instance**        | ❌ No                         | Secondary regions cannot accept writes (unless promoted).                                                  |
| **Storage layer**          | ✅ Yes                        | Aurora **automatically replicates the storage layer** to secondary regions using dedicated infrastructure. |

---

## 📦 So what exactly is replicated?

* **Storage data** is asynchronously replicated from the **primary region to each secondary region**.
* Replication is done at the **Aurora storage layer**, not via logical or binary replication like RDS.
* Replication lag is typically **<1 second** due to low-level storage changes being shipped, not SQL commands.

---

## ✅ Summary

* Secondary region **does have storage**, which is **a replicated copy** of the primary's storage.
* It also supports **read-only DB instances** (you launch them).
* You **can’t write** in the secondary region — unless you **promote** it to primary (failover).

Let me know if you want to add a short flow or diagram for this in `aurora.md`.

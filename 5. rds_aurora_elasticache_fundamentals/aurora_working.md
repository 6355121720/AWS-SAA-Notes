Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s the **final full version** with both **writer and reader flows**, in clear, short format:

---

### ðŸ”¹ Single-Writer Aurora

**Writer Flow:**

1. **Only 1 writer instance** in the cluster
2. App sends write to **that writer only**
3. Writer sends to **6 storage nodes**
4. Waits for **4/6 ACKs** â†’ **commit success**

**Reader Flow:**

1. App connects to **read replicas** (up to 15)
2. Each replica reads from **3 of 6 storage nodes** (fastest responders)
3. Readers see **latest committed data**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Multi-Writer Aurora

**Writer Flow:**

1. **Up to 5 writer instances** in the cluster (Aurora MySQL only)
2. App can write to **any writer** (you manage load balancing)
3. Writer sends to **6 storage nodes**
4. Waits for **4/6 ACKs** â†’ **commit**
5. Aurora handles **conflicts** (locking or last-writer-wins)

**Reader Flow:**

1. App connects to **any writer or reader instance**
2. Reads still go to **3 of 6 storage nodes** (quorum read)
3. Ensures **low-latency + consistency**

---

âœ… Shared storage + 6-way replication used by all writers and readers.
âœ… Read replicas have **no storage** â€” only compute, reading directly from the shared backend.

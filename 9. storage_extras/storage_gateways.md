Absolutely! Here's your **complete, deeply detailed, yet clear explanation of AWS Storage Gateway**, including **how it works, real-world use cases, internal flows, and key points** — especially from your perspective (on-prem existing data + cloud for new data):

## 🏗️ What is AWS Storage Gateway?


**AWS Storage Gateway** is a **hybrid cloud storage service** that acts as a **bridge between on-premise environments(apps, websites, etc) and AWS cloud storage** (mostly S3, EBS, or Glacier).

It lets your on-premises applications access AWS cloud storage (like S3 or Glacier) as if it were a local disk — so you don’t need to modify or rewrite your existing applications.

***If you dont understand above, read below***

Let’s say you have an on-premises system where existing data is stored locally, but you now want all new data to be stored in the cloud (like S3 or EBS), without rewriting your existing applications.

To achieve this:

✅ You create a storage bucket in AWS (e.g., S3) for new data.

✅ You deploy AWS Storage Gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on-premises.

✅ This Storage Gateway provides local interfaces (like NFS, SMB, or iSCSI) that your apps already understand — so they can read/write to cloud storage as if it were local.

✅ It caches frequently used data locally using its built-in storage, memory, and compute, which improves performance.

✅ The gateway sends data asynchronously to AWS in the background — keeping things efficient and cloud-backed.

✅ You don’t need to rewrite your applications to talk directly to AWS (no need to integrate AWS SDKs).

## 🧠 Why Use It?

Many companies:

* Have **existing data and applications on-premises**
* Want to **keep using those systems** (for compliance, latency, cost)
* But want to **leverage cloud scalability, durability, and backups**

**Storage Gateway solves this exact hybrid problem**.

## 🧪 Gateway Types (3 Flavors)

| Type                  | Backed By            | Mounts As                  | Use Case                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **File Gateway**    | Amazon S3            | NFS / SMB share            | Backup files, logs, images, media from on-prem to S3        |
| 🟩 **Volume Gateway** | Amazon EBS Snapshots | iSCSI block device         | Backup disk volumes for DR or VM snapshots                  |
| 🟦 **Tape Gateway**   | Amazon Glacier       | Virtual Tape Library (VTL) | Replace physical backup tapes with virtual tapes in Glacier |

Your question and use case focus on **File Gateway**, so we’ll dive deeper into that now.

## 🔁 How File Gateway Works (With Flow Example)

### 🎯 Use Case:

> Backup daily logs from your on-prem **web server** into **S3**, while keeping **local performance** and **app compatibility**.

---

### 🔄 Flow Step-by-Step:

1. **Deploy Gateway**:

   * Deploy as a **VM** or **hardware appliance** on-prem, or use **Snowball Edge** in remote locations.
   * Configure it as a **File Gateway**.
   * Connect it to your AWS account.

2. **Create S3 Bucket**:

   * Gateway will use an S3 bucket as its **backing store**.

3. **Mount NFS/SMB Share**:

   * Gateway exposes a shareable **NFS/SMB mount point** (like a network drive).
   * Mount this on your on-prem servers.

4. **Apps Write to Gateway**:

   * Your on-prem apps **write files** (e.g., logs, backups, images) to this mount point.
   * To the app, it's just a folder — no S3 API needed.

5. **Gateway Caches Locally**:

   * Files are **cached locally** in the gateway's disk for fast performance and low-latency access.

6. **Data Uploaded to S3**:

   * In the background, data is **asynchronously uploaded to S3**.
   * This gives you a **cloud backup** automatically.

7. **Reading Files**:

   * If your app reads a file:

     * ✅ If cached → served instantly
     * ❌ Not cached → pulled from S3 and cached again

---

### 🗂️ Real-World Example:

> 🔹 Suppose you run a small data center for a **college** storing **CCTV video**, **student records**, and **logs**.
> 🔹 You want to offload that to S3 to reduce cost but still want local access.

* Mount the File Gateway as `\\storage-gateway\student-backups`
* All backups written here are:

  * 🧠 Cached locally
  * ☁️ Stored safely in S3
* If power fails or the local disk fails, data is still safe in S3.

---

## 🧠 Key Points and Concepts

### ✅ Sync Direction:

* **From On-Prem → Cloud (S3)** ✅
* **From S3 → On-Prem** ❌ (only reads are fetched when requested)

### ✅ Caching:

* Recently accessed files are cached locally for low latency.
* You can configure how much disk to use for cache.

### ✅ Application Compatibility:

* Your app doesn’t know it’s talking to the cloud — it just writes to a mounted drive.

---

## 🔐 Security

* Data in-transit: **Encrypted with TLS**
* Data at-rest: **Stored encrypted in S3 (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)**
* IAM policies restrict what the gateway can do

## 💡 Best Use Cases

| Use Case             | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧾 File backups      | Logs, reports, DB backup files                                                          |
| 🖼️ Media assets     | Images, videos, and design files written from on-prem                                   |
| 🧪 Lab data          | Large experimental data needing long-term archival                                      |
| 💽 Local NAS offload | Move infrequently used files to cloud, keep hot ones cached locally                     |
| 🚜 Remote locations  | Use File Gateway with Snowball Edge in disconnected environments (like mining, farming) |

## ❗ Important Notes

* **Existing on-prem storage stays intact** — Gateway doesn’t touch it.
* You write **new data** to the **gateway’s mount point** — it pushes to S3 and caches locally.
* **Bi-directional sync (S3 ↔ on-prem NAS)** is not done. Gateway is **not a sync tool**, it’s a **bridge with caching** and cloud push.

## 🚫 What It’s Not For

| Misuse                 | Reason                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌ Database syncing     | Use DataSync or native DB backup tools           |

---

## 🧪 Summary

> AWS **Storage Gateway (File Gateway)** lets your on-prem apps **write to a cloud-backed share** with local caching.
> It's **ideal when you want cloud backup but keep your apps unchanged and storage partly on-prem**.

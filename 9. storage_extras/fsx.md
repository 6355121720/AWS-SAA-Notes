## üöÄ What is AWS FSx?

**Amazon FSx** = Fully managed **file systems** in the cloud (like cloud hard drives, but for big apps and shared environments).
You choose **which type of file system** you want based on your need (Windows, Linux, high speed, etc.).

---

## üìÇ First ‚Äî What Is a File System?

> A **file system** organizes and stores files on a disk ‚Äî like NTFS on Windows, or Lustre in supercomputers.
> AWS FSx gives you **fully managed versions of popular file systems** used in real-world apps.

## üß† Types of Amazon FSx (Pick Based on Your Need):

### 1. ü™ü **FSx for Windows File Server**

* Built on **Windows NTFS**
* Fully compatible with **Active Directory**, SMB (file sharing on Windows)
* For Windows apps needing shared drives
* ‚úÖ Use case: Windows-based business apps (like SAP, SharePoint)

---

### 2. üß¨ **FSx for Lustre**

* High-performance file system used in **HPC** (High-Performance Computing)
* Integrates with **S3**: Reads S3 data as if it‚Äôs local
* ‚úÖ Use case: ML training, genomics, video rendering

---

### 3. üêß **FSx for OpenZFS**

* Based on **ZFS**, a powerful Linux file system with snapshots, compression, and performance
* Good for DevOps, CI/CD, or backups
* ‚úÖ Use case: Linux workloads needing advanced file features

---

### 4. üßæ **FSx for NetApp ONTAP**

* Enterprise-grade storage used by many companies on-prem
* Supports **NFS, SMB, and iSCSI** ‚Äî highly flexible
* Has snapshots, replication, deduplication
* ‚úÖ Use case: Hybrid cloud apps, disaster recovery, advanced file needs

## ‚úÖ Why Use FSx Instead of EC2 + EBS?

* FSx is **shared**, **POSIX-compliant**, **managed**
* No need to set up or patch your own file servers
* Used for **multi-user**, **large-scale**, **high-availability** file-based workloads

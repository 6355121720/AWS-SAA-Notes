## ❄️ AWS Snowball — In Depth, In Short

### 🔹 What is it?

AWS Snowball is a **physical, rugged device** used to **move large amounts of data** between your on-premises site and AWS — **securely and efficiently**, **offline** or with minimal bandwidth.

It can also transfer data online via DataSync(running datasync agent on snowball. But it is not cost effective, as we are not using only compute of snowball).

### 🚛 Two Core Use Cases:

| Use Case           | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Transfer**  | Migrate 10s–100s of TBs of data to/from AWS             |
| **Edge Computing** | Run compute workloads (EC2, Lambda, ML) at remote sites |

## 🧱 Snowball Device Types

| Device                                 | Purpose                      | Compute?        | Storage            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| ❄️ **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized** | Large data migration         | ❌ (minimal)     | \~80–210 TB usable |
| 💻 **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized** | Edge processing + data move  | ✅ (EC2, Lambda) | \~42 TB usable     |
| 🎮 **Snowball Edge Compute w/ GPU**    | ML, video processing at edge | ✅ (w/ GPU)      | \~42 TB usable     |

## 🛠️ How It Works (Data Migration Workflow)

1. ✅ Order Snowball from AWS Console (specify amount of data, region)
2. 📦 AWS ships encrypted device to your location
3. 🔌 Connect it to your LAN via high-speed ports (10 Gbps+)
4. 🧠 Transfer data using **Snowball client** or **S3-compatible APIs**
5. 📬 Ship device back to AWS
6. ☁️ AWS uploads data to S3 securely

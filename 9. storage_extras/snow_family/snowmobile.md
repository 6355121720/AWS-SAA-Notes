### üìå What is AWS Snowmobile?

**AWS Snowmobile** is a **physically massive data migration service** designed for **exabyte-scale (up to 100 PB)** data transfers from on-premises data centers to AWS ‚Äî via a **literal semi-truck (18-wheeler) data center**.

> It is the **largest-scale data transfer service in the world**, meant for organizations needing to **move 10s of PB to 100 PB** securely and efficiently.

## üîß Core Architecture & Process

### üîπ 1. **Initial Assessment**

* AWS works with customer to understand scale (PBs), network limitations, security needs.
* AWS sends **Snowmobile container (45-foot rugged truck)** to customer site.

### üîπ 2. **On-Site Setup**

| Element           | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power**         | Snowmobile connects to facility's power or brings its own generator               |
| **Network**       | Connected via high-speed fiber to customer DC                                     |
| **Local Servers** | Connect your SAN/NAS/storage fabric via NFS/iSCSI/SMB/etc.                        |
| **Data Transfer** | Multiple 40 Gbps or 100 Gbps fiber interfaces ‚Äî transfer **1 TB every \~5‚Äì7 min** |

### üîπ 3. **Data Copying**

* Data is copied over **encrypted** using **256-bit encryption keys**.
* Snowmobile includes **DataSync**-like software for parallelized transfer.

### üîπ 4. **Return and Ingestion**

* Snowmobile drives back to **AWS Region** with physical escort.
* Data is uploaded to **Amazon S3 or Glacier**.
* AWS deletes local copy **after full ingestion + your confirmation**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security ‚Äî Military-Grade

| Layer                     | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AES-256 Encryption**    | All data is encrypted at rest and in transit                        |
| **Customer-managed keys** | Use your own AWS KMS keys                                           |
| **Chain-of-custody**      | GPS-tracked, monitored, **armed security escort** with truck        |
| **Physical Locks**        | Tamper-resistant container with hardened doors, keypads, biometrics |
| **CCTV + Alarms**         | 24x7 video monitoring, motion sensors, shock sensors                |
| **Wipe on confirmation**  | AWS wipes disks only after **you approve** successful upload        |

> ‚úÖ AWS guarantees **highest level of physical and digital security** ‚Äî ideal for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense).

## üöÄ Transfer Performance

| Metric                      | Value                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Max Capacity**            | 100 PB per truck (45-foot container)           |
| **Speed**                   | \~1 TB every 5‚Äì7 minutes (using 40/100 Gbps)   |
| **Time to transfer 100 PB** | \~10 days (on-prem transfer) + \~1 week return |
| **Network Equivalence**     | Would take **20+ years** over 1 Gbps link      |

> ‚ùóTransferring 100 PB over the internet is **not practical** ‚Äî Snowmobile is **literally faster than fiber** in massive cases.

## üß† Final Thoughts: AWS Snowmobile

> **AWS Snowmobile is not just a product, it‚Äôs a project.**

It‚Äôs ideal for **mass-scale, ultra-secure, physically bound** data migration needs, when **network isn‚Äôt an option** ‚Äî e.g., **you‚Äôd take years to upload** 100 PB.

It brings:

* **Military-grade physical + logical security**
* **Extreme scale** (up to 100 PB/truck)
* **Faster than fiber**
* Real feasibility for **mass cloud migration**

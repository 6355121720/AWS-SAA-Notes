Great question — they sound similar but are completely different tools with very different purposes. Let’s break it down clearly and visually so your confusion is gone forever 🔥.

🆚 App Runner vs App2Container (A2C)

Feature / Purpose	AWS App Runner	AWS App2Container (A2C)

🔧 What it is	Fully managed service to run containerized web apps	CLI tool to convert legacy apps to Docker containers
🎯 Main Use Case	Run your web app/API from code or container without managing servers	Take an existing app running on a VM or EC2 and containerize it for cloud
💡 Use When	You already have a container image or source code and want to deploy it easily	You have an existing Java/.NET app running on a server and want to modernize/migrate it
🛠 Who Builds the Container?	App Runner builds container for you (if using source code)	You use A2C to generate Dockerfile and image yourself
🚀 What You Deploy	Source code (GitHub) or Docker image (ECR)	Docker container (after A2C builds it from old app)
📦 Runs Docker Internally?	✅ Yes — builds and runs containers under the hood	✅ Yes — helps you build container image yourself
⚙ Deployment Target	App Runner itself	ECS, EKS, App Runner (after containerizing)
🖥 Example Scenario	You push your Node.js app to GitHub → App Runner builds & hosts it	You have an old Java WAR on EC2 → Use A2C to turn it into a container → Deploy to ECS

🧠 One-Line Summary to Remember

> 🟢 App Runner = Platform to run your container/web app
🔵 App2Container = Tool to create a container from a legacy app




---

🔁 How They Can Work Together (Real-World Flow)

1. You have an old .NET/Java app running on a Windows Server.


2. Use App2Container to convert it into a Docker image.


3. Push the image to Amazon ECR.


4. Deploy that image using App Runner (or ECS/EKS).



So:

> 🧱 App2Container = Create the container
🚀 App Runner = Run the container

Sure! Here's your updated short and in-depth App Runner response — now including that it runs Docker containers internally:


---

🚀 AWS App Runner (In Short)

Fully managed service to run web apps and APIs directly from source code or container images — no infrastructure or orchestration to manage.


---

✅ Core Features

Feature	Description

Runs Docker Containers Internally	Always runs your app inside containers — even if you deploy from source code
Source Options	Deploy from GitHub (code) or Amazon ECR (Docker image)
Auto Build & Deploy	For GitHub, it automatically builds your code into a container using CodeBuild behind the scenes
HTTPS by Default	TLS termination and load balancing out-of-the-box
Auto Scaling	Scales from 0 to many instances based on HTTP traffic
VPC Access	Can connect to private RDS, ElastiCache, etc., via VPC connector



---

🧠 How It Works Internally

Source Type	Behind the Scenes

GitHub	App Runner builds a Docker image from code using a buildpack or Dockerfile → then runs it in an isolated container
Amazon ECR	App Runner pulls and runs the container image directly


> 🔐 You never manage servers, EC2, Kubernetes, or Docker runtimes — AWS handles everything.

💰 Pricing

You pay for:

vCPU & memory per second

Time when your app is actively handling requests



---

🧪 Best Use Cases

Deploying web apps, REST APIs, or microservices

No infra/team to manage scaling/load balancing

You want to go from code → URL quickly

📝 Exam Tip (SAA-C03)

App Runner is ideal when you want zero-infrastructure, HTTPS-ready, and auto-scaled containerized web apps or APIs.

It always runs containers internally, even from source code — you just don’t have to manage or see them.

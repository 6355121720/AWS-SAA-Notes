# 🛠️ AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) – Full Notes

### ✅ What is AWS DMS?

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps you **migrate databases** to AWS **quickly and securely**. It supports one-time and ongoing data replication with **minimal downtime**.

## 📦 Supported Use Cases

| Use Case                         | Description                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **One-time migration**         | Move your data from source DB to AWS (e.g., on-prem MySQL → Amazon RDS). After migration, you **stop using DMS**.                     |
| 🔁 **Ongoing replication (CDC)** | Start with full load, then **enable Change Data Capture** to replicate real-time changes until cutover. Ideal for near-zero downtime. |
| 🔄 **Hybrid & cloud-to-cloud**   | Migrate data across **different cloud providers**, or between **on-prem and cloud**, or **AWS to AWS** (e.g., RDS to Aurora).         |

---

## 🧱 Architecture (Simplified)

```
[Source DB] → [DMS Replication Instance] → [Target DB]
                |
                +--> Handles migration tasks (full + CDC)
```

* **Source DBs**: On-premises (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL), RDS, EC2-hosted, etc.
* **Target DBs**: Amazon RDS, Aurora, Redshift, S3 (for analytics), Kinesis, etc.

## 🔄 Types of Migrations

| Type               | Explanation                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Full Load Only   | Migrate existing data only, no ongoing sync.                             |
| 🔁 Full Load + CDC | Migrate existing data, then capture changes (CDC) in near real-time.     |
| 🔁 CDC Only        | If DB is already loaded manually, use CDC to replicate only the changes. |

## 🧪 Real-World Migration Example (Timeline)

### Scenario: 2-Day Migration

1. **Day 1:**

   * Launch DMS task (full load)
   * Enable CDC (ongoing changes captured)
2. **Day 2 (cutover day):**

   * Pause source DB writes
   * Let DMS catch up on changes (delta sync)
   * Point app to the AWS DB (target)
   * **Stop DMS task and delete it**

🔹 **Result:** Application is now live on AWS DB, and DMS is no longer needed.

## 📌 Key Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi AZ (if enabled)     | replicates in multi az for high resilience                           |
| 🔐 Encrypted & secure     | Uses SSL, KMS encryption                                             |
| 📈 High throughput        | Suitable for TB-scale migrations                                     |
| 🌍 Heterogeneous support  | Migrate between different engines(Use Schema Coversion Tool(SCT) for that) (e.g., Oracle → Aurora)            |
| 🔄 Continuous replication | Change Data Capture (CDC) for low-downtime/live migration            |
| 🔎 Monitoring             | CloudWatch metrics + logs + task progress monitoring                 |
| 💰 Pay-as-you-go          | You pay **only while replication task is active** (per hour pricing) |

## 🧠 Important Reminders

* ✅ **DMS is temporary** — used **only during migration**, not long-term.
* 🚫 Not meant to replace full ETL tools like AWS Glue.
* 🛑 Stop the DMS task once migration + cutover is done.
* 🧩 You can chain DMS with **Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)** if migrating between different engines (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL).

## 🔍 Summary

| Question                                            | Answer                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Should DMS run permanently?                         | ❌ No — it is a temporary migration tool                   |
| What happens after migration?                       | ✅ App is cut over to the AWS DB, DMS task is terminated   |
| Can DMS migrate ongoing changes?                    | ✅ Yes, via CDC (Change Data Capture)                      |
| What if source and target are different DB engines? | Use **DMS + SCT** for schema conversion and data movement |

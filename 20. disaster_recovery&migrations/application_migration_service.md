Here’s the **refined, real-world version** of your AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) notes — deeply structured and aligned with how professionals use it in cloud migration projects:

---

# 🚀 AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)

### ✅ **Purpose**

AWS MGN is used for **Lift-and-Shift (Rehosting)** migration of **on-premises or other-cloud workloads** to AWS **with minimal downtime**.

> 🧠 Ideal when you want to **preserve your existing apps and servers** but run them in AWS, without redesigning.

---

## 🧭 Cloud Migration – Big Picture

There are two main paths to migrate to the cloud:

| Approach                   | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ☁️ Cloud-native rebuild    | Start fresh — re-architect using AWS-native services (e.g., Lambda, RDS). |
| 🚚 Lift-and-shift (Rehost) | Move existing servers "as-is" to AWS with minimal change and downtime.    |

---

## 🔍 Step 1: **Plan Your Migration**

Use **AWS Application Discovery Service** to analyze your on-prem setup.

### 🛠️ Discovery Modes:

| Mode                         | Use Case                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚙️ Agentless (via Connector) | High-level info from VMware vCenter: config, VM size, CPU/mem/disk history.                                                                  |
| 🧬 Agent-based (per server)  | Deep-level insight: installed apps, running processes, system-level metrics, **network dependencies**. Needed for proper dependency mapping. |

📍 **All data is sent to [AWS Migration Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/)** — a central dashboard to:

* View discovered servers
* Map interdependencies
* Track migration progress

## 🚚 Step 2: **Migrate Using AWS MGN**

### 🔄 How It Works:

1. **Install AWS Replication Agent** on source servers (physical/VM/cloud).
2. Agent starts **continuous block-level replication** to AWS (stored in staging area).
3. AWS MGN creates **lightweight EC2+EBS instances** to receive this data.
4. When ready, you perform the **cutover** to production EC2s.

> 🟢 You can **right-size the EC2 instance** during cutover to match desired performance and cost.

## ⏱️ Cutover Process (Minimal Downtime)

| Phase            | Action                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔁 Replication   | Continuous data sync to staging area (low-cost EC2 + EBS).         |
| 🧪 Testing       | Launch test instances in AWS to validate the app and environment.  |
| ✂️ Final Cutover | Stop writes to source, wait for replication to catch up, cut over. |

## 🧩 Supported Workloads

✅ Physical Servers
✅ VMs (VMware, Hyper-V, KVM)
✅ Other cloud VMs (Azure, GCP)
✅ Databases, App servers, Web servers

## 🎯 Benefits of AWS MGN

| Benefit                          | Details                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚡ Fast & automated               | No manual snapshots or conversions needed.                                   |
| ⏳ Minimal downtime               | Thanks to continuous replication and cutover control.                        |
| 💸 Cost-efficient                | Uses low-cost EC2 instances for staging. Pay only during migration.          |
| 🧱 OS-level fidelity             | Keeps original OS, apps, and settings — no need to refactor or re-architect. |
| 🔍 Integrated with Migration Hub | Easily monitor all migrations in one dashboard.                              |

## 🆚 DMS vs MGN

| Feature                | DMS                              | MGN                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Use case               | Migrate **databases only**       | Migrate **full servers/workloads**   |
| Level                  | DB-level (tables, rows, CDC)     | Server-level (OS, app, data, config) |
| Continuous replication | Yes (CDC)                        | Yes                                  |
| Cutover type           | App layer (change DB connection) | Full system cutover                  |

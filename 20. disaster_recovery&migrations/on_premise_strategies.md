# üè† On-Premises Strategies with AWS

When migrating from **on-premises infrastructure to AWS**, or maintaining **hybrid environments**, AWS provides several tools and services to support VM, server, and database migration ‚Äî as well as visibility and control during the transition.

---

## üìÄ **Amazon Linux 2 ISO for On-Prem**

You can run **Amazon Linux 2** on-premises by downloading it as an **ISO image**, which works with common virtualization platforms:

* ‚úÖ VMware
* ‚úÖ KVM
* ‚úÖ VirtualBox (Oracle VM)
* ‚úÖ Microsoft Hyper-V

This allows:

* Running AWS-compatible environments **on-premises**
* Testing **cloud-like instances** locally
* Using **User Data scripts** to preconfigure your VMs

> üìå **Use case:** Great for developers or hybrid IT teams to simulate EC2-like behavior on-prem.

---

## üîÑ VM Import/Export

VM Import/Export is all about migrating full VM images (including the OS, apps, and configuration) between your on-prem environment and AWS EC2.

| Feature   | Details                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üîº Import | Bring your **existing VM images** (e.g. from VMware, VirtualBox) into AWS EC2. |
| üîΩ Export | Export AWS EC2 instances back to your **on-premises hypervisor** if needed.    |

‚úÖ Supported formats: VMDK, VHD, OVA
‚úÖ Used for **cloud migration** or **disaster recovery backups** of VMs

> üí° Real-world use case: Backup production VMs into AWS for redundancy. Or lift-and-shift on-prem VMs to EC2.

---

## AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS)

Helps plan migrations by collecting:

* ‚úÖ CPU, RAM, disk, network usage
* ‚úÖ OS, installed software, server metadata
* ‚úÖ App dependencies (who talks to whom)
* ‚úÖ Active ports, processes, and services
* ‚úÖ Hostnames, IPs, hardware details

üîß Use it to group, size, and prioritize apps for cloud migration.

---

## üìä AWS Migration Hub

**Migration Hub = Central Dashboard**

Track the **status of all your migrations** in one place, whether you're using:

* AWS Application Discovery Service
* AWS DMS / SMS
* 3rd party tools (e.g. CloudEndure, partner tools)

> üß≠ Gives visibility across multiple tools and accounts ‚Äî important in large-scale migrations.

---

## üõ¢Ô∏è AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

**Use DMS to migrate databases:**

| Source/Target | Supported directions                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| On-prem ‚Üí AWS | ‚úÖ Yes (e.g., Oracle ‚Üí RDS Postgres)    |
| AWS ‚Üí AWS     | ‚úÖ Yes (e.g., RDS ‚Üí Aurora)             |
| AWS ‚Üí On-prem | ‚úÖ Yes (e.g., RDS ‚Üí on-prem SQL Server) |

Supports both:

* **One-time migration** ‚úÖ
* **Ongoing replication (CDC)** üîÅ

> üìå Can migrate from MySQL to DynamoDB using DMS.
> üí° Often used for **zero-downtime** database cutovers.

---

üñ•Ô∏è **AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)**
Migrate full on-prem servers (not just DBs) to AWS:

* ‚úÖ Replicates server volumes incrementally (after 1st full copy)
* ‚úÖ Creates **multiple AMIs** ‚Äî you can launch EC2 from **any point in time**
* ‚úÖ Supports Windows & Linux VMs
* ‚úÖ Uses on-prem connector agent to send data to AWS

üß© Great for full server migration, live backups, or DR with restore flexibility.

| Service                    | Use Case                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon Linux 2 ISO         | Run EC2-like environment on-prem via ISO VM                         |
| VM Import/Export           | Move VM images between on-prem and AWS EC2                          |
| Application Discovery Service | Gather data about on-prem servers for migration planning            |
| Migration Hub              | Track overall progress of all your migration tools in one dashboard |
| Database Migration Service | Migrate/replicate databases across on-prem and cloud                |
| Server Migration Service   | Incrementally replicate full server volumes into AWS                |

## üéØ Final Takeaways

* These services help you **assess**, **migrate**, **track**, and **test** workloads across hybrid environments.
* VM Import/Export, DMS, and SMS are actual migration tools.
* ADS and Migration Hub are **planning & tracking** tools.
* Amazon Linux 2 ISO is a **testing/simulation** solution for on-prem cloud-compatible environments.

# 🛡️ AWS Backup — In-Depth Notes

## 🚀 What is AWS Backup?

**AWS Backup** is a **fully managed, centralized backup service** that allows you to **automate, monitor, and enforce backup policies** across a wide range of AWS services — without needing custom scripts, manual jobs, or third-party tools.

> Think of it as a **single pane of glass** to manage backups **across your entire AWS environment**.

## 📋 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Backup Plan

A **Backup Plan** is a policy that defines:

* **What** to back up (via resource selection or tags)
* **How often** (backup frequency: hourly/daily/weekly/monthly or cron)
* **When** to run (preferred backup window)
* **Retention** period (e.g., 7 days, 6 months, 1 year)
* **Transition** to cold storage (for cost optimization)

### 🔹 Backup Vault

* A **secure storage container** for your backups
* Can be encrypted (AWS KMS)
* **Vault Lock** can enforce immutability (WORM)

### 🔹 Backup Job

* A single **execution of a backup plan**
* Can be **manual (on-demand)** or **automatic (scheduled)**

## 🔐 Vault Lock – WORM Protection

| 🔒 Feature          | Details                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What it does        | Enforces **Write Once Read Many (WORM)** policy on a Backup Vault      |
| Purpose             | Prevents deletion, modification, or early expiration of backups        |
| Even root cannot... | … delete or change retention once Vault Lock is **in Compliance mode** |
| Ideal for           | Financial data, compliance workloads (HIPAA, FINRA, etc.)              |

---

## 🔁 Cross-Region & Cross-Account

| Type                   | Benefit                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌍 Cross-region backup | Backup from us-east-1 → restore in eu-west-1 (DR ready) |
| 👥 Cross-account       | Backup in Prod account → Restore in DR or Audit account |

* Uses **AWS Organizations**
* Helps implement **multi-account, multi-region resilience**

---

## 🛠 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. You create a **Backup Plan** (via AWS Console, CLI, or API)
2. You assign **resources or tags** to the plan
3. AWS Backup performs **snapshots or service-native backups** behind the scenes

   * EBS → snapshot
   * RDS → snapshot
   * DynamoDB → point-in-time backup
   * EFS → file-system level snapshot
4. Backups are **stored in S3 (internally managed)** — not user-visible
5. You can **restore directly** from AWS Backup Console/CLI/API

---

## 💵 Pricing Overview

You’re charged for:

* **Backup storage** used (per GB-month)
* **Restore requests**
* **Cross-region data transfer**

💡 Backups stored using AWS Backup are often **cheaper** than manual snapshots (e.g., EBS).

| Disaster recovery                   | Automated cross-region backups ensure you can restore services elsewhere  |
| Production compliance (HIPAA, PCI)  | Vault Lock and audit logs support regulatory requirements                 |
| Dev/Test snapshots                  | Manual on-demand backups let you clone environments safely                |
| Centralized backup in multi-account | Use AWS Organizations to back up across prod, staging, DR accounts easily |

# 🚨 AWS Disaster Recovery – The Architect’s Playbook

## 🔍 What Is a Disaster?

A **disaster** is any unplanned event that disrupts business — hardware failure, natural calamities, software bugs, or human error.

> **Disaster Recovery (DR)** = Prepare, survive, and recover with minimal **data loss (RPO)** and **downtime (RTO)**.

---

## 🧭 Key Metrics: RPO vs RTO

| Term    | Full Form                | Definition                                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RPO** | Recovery Point Objective | Max **acceptable data loss** in time (e.g., “we can lose 1 hour of data”) |
| **RTO** | Recovery Time Objective  | Max **acceptable downtime** before systems must be restored               |

> ✅ Lower RPO/RTO = Higher cost, higher resilience.

## 🧱 DR Architecture Types in AWS

| Type                            | Description                         | Example             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **On-prem ↔ On-prem**           | Traditional, expensive              | CA ↔ NY DC          |
| **Hybrid**                      | On-prem as primary, AWS as failover | Partial cloud       |
| **All-in Cloud (Multi-Region)** | Fully AWS with cross-region DR      | Region A ↔ Region B |

---

## 🧰 DR Strategy Spectrum (Low Cost → High Cost)

Let’s explore **4 AWS DR strategies**, each balancing **cost ↔ recovery speed**.

### 1️⃣ Backup & Restore 🪣

* Store backups (EBS, RDS snapshots, S3, Glacier)
* No active compute running
* Recovery = rehydrate infrastructure from snapshots/AMIs

| RPO: High (hours–days) | RTO: High (hours) | 💰 Cost: Lowest |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |

> **Use When:** Budget is tight, recovery time is not critical

✅ **Tips**:

* Store backups in **S3 IA** or **Glacier Deep Archive**
* Automate restore with **CloudFormation**
* Use **Storage Gateway** or **Snowball** for on-prem → AWS

---

### 2️⃣ Pilot Light 🔥

* Minimal infra running (e.g., DB in sync on RDS)
* Critical components hot, others cold
* On disaster, scale up EC2s, load balancers, app layers

| RPO: Medium (minutes–hours) | RTO: Medium (tens of minutes) | 💰 Cost: Low |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |

> **Use When:** You need faster recovery without full duplication

✅ **Example**:

* RDS replicates in real-time
* EC2s launched on-demand via AMIs
* DNS switched via Route 53

---

### 3️⃣ Warm Standby 🌥️

* Full environment is live, but scaled down
* All components running at minimal capacity
* Scale up quickly during disaster

| RPO: Low (minutes) | RTO: Low (minutes) | 💰 Cost: Medium |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |

> **Use When:** Moderate cost and fast recovery needed

✅ **Tactics**:

* Pre-provision ALBs, EC2, RDS (replica)
* Use **Auto Scaling** to ramp up
* **Route 53 failover** to switch traffic

---

### 4️⃣ Multi-Site (Hot-Hot) 🔥🔥

* Fully active infra in **two locations** (on-prem/cloud or multi-region)
* Real-time sync + traffic distributed (active-active)

| RPO: Lowest (seconds) | RTO: Lowest (seconds) | 💰 Cost: Highest |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |

> **Use When:** Mission-critical apps, 0-downtime expected

✅ **Tactics**:

* Use **Aurora Global DB**, **S3 CRR**, **DynamoDB Global Tables**
* **Route 53 latency/geo routing**
* Active traffic in both regions

---

## 🌐 Multi-Region DR in the Cloud

AWS enables powerful **region-level DR**:

* **Aurora Global Database** → Primary in `us-east-1`, replica in `eu-west-1`
* **S3 Cross-Region Replication**
* **DynamoDB Global Tables** with multi-master writes
* Use **Route 53 + Health Checks** to redirect traffic instantly

## 🧠 Strategy Comparison Table

| Strategy         | RPO        | RTO        | Cost     | Infra Always On? |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Backup & Restore | Hours–Days | Hours      | 💸 Low   | ❌                |
| Pilot Light      | Minutes    | 10s of min | 💸💸     | Partially        |
| Warm Standby     | Minutes    | Minutes    | 💸💸💸   | ✅ (minimal)      |
| Multi-Site       | Seconds    | Seconds    | 💸💸💸💸 | ✅ Full           |

---

## 🛡 Best Practices for AWS DR

* ✅ **Backups**: Use scheduled snapshots for EC2, RDS, EBS, DynamoDB.
* ✅ **Cross-Region Replication**: For critical buckets, databases, and tables.
* ✅ **Infrastructure as Code**: Use CloudFormation to spin up infra on demand.
* ✅ **DNS Failover**: Use **Route 53** health checks and routing policies.
* ✅ **Networking**: Pair **Direct Connect** with **VPN** for hybrid DR.
* ✅ **Automated Recovery**: With **CloudWatch**, **Lambda**, and **SNS**.
* ✅ **Multi-AZ** vs **Multi-Region**:

  * Multi-AZ = High Availability
  * Multi-Region = Full Disaster Recovery

---

## 💥 Chaos Engineering (Disaster Testing)

> Don’t **assume** DR works — **test it!**

* Practice **controlled failures**
* Netflix's **Simian Army** (e.g., Chaos Monkey) randomly kills resources to test resilience
* Use AWS **Fault Injection Simulator** to test failover behavior

## 🎯 Exam Strategy Tips

| Situation                                  | Pick This Strategy     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Lowest cost, data backup only              | Backup & Restore       |
| RDS always running, EC2 booted on disaster | Pilot Light            |
| All services running at low capacity       | Warm Standby           |
| Full infra in two regions                  | Multi-Site             |
| Multi-region database with fast failover   | Aurora Global DB       |
| Restore infra with automation              | Use CloudFormation     |
| DNS-based region redirection               | Route 53 with failover |

## ✅ Final Takeaways

* 🔁 **RPO** = How much data you’re willing to lose
* 🕒 **RTO** = How fast you need to come back up
* 🎯 Your DR strategy should **match your business needs**
* 🧪 Use **automation + chaos testing** to validate your DR plan

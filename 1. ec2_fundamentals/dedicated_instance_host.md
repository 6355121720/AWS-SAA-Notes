## 🧩 Goal: Isolation from Other Tenants

Both **Dedicated Instances** and **Dedicated Hosts** give you EC2 on **hardware not shared with other AWS customers** (unlike default EC2 which is multi-tenant).

But they differ in **control, use cases, licensing, and visibility**.

---

## 🏠 1. Dedicated Instances — "No Sharing, But No Control"

> 🧱 **Physically isolated EC2 instances**, but you don’t manage the host.

### ✅ Key Features:

* Your EC2 runs on **hardware not shared** with others.
* You **don’t see or control** the physical server.
* AWS places your instances on **isolated hardware**, but **you don’t reserve the host**.
* **Charged per instance**, **hourly billing** (no savings with host-level reservations).
* **Good for simple isolation** needs (e.g., security compliance).

### ❌ Limitations:

* No control over **instance placement** (e.g., can't use existing host capacity).
* Not suitable for **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** for Windows/SQL.

---

## 🧩 2. Dedicated Host — "Full Physical Server Visibility"

> 🏗️ You **reserve the entire physical server**, get control of placement, and can run multiple EC2s on it.

### ✅ Key Features:

* You **control the host** — can launch instances on specific sockets/cores.
* Enables **BYOL (Bring Your Own License)** for OS/software like Windows Server, SQL Server.
* You can **reuse your licenses** that require per-socket/per-core compliance.
* Visibility into **host-level metrics**, inventory, and usage.
* Charged **per host**, not per instance — often **cheaper** if fully utilized.

### 💡 Use Cases:

* Software licensing compliance (BYOL).
* Regulatory/compliance requirements needing host-level isolation.
* Full control over **instance placement** (e.g., affinity, anti-affinity).

## 🔍 Key Differences — Side-by-Side

| Feature                    | Dedicated Instance                | Dedicated Host                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Isolation                  | ✅ Physical isolation              | ✅ Physical isolation           |
| Billing model              | 💵 Per-instance                   | 💵 Per-host                    |
| BYOL Licensing             | ❌ Not supported                   | ✅ Supported                    |
| Host visibility            | ❌ No                              | ✅ Yes                          |
| Instance placement control | ❌ No                              | ✅ Yes (Affinity, etc.)         |
| Cost efficiency            | ❌ Less (especially underutilized) | ✅ Better if host is fully used |
| Control over cores/sockets | ❌ No                              | ✅ Yes                          |

## ✅ Summary

| Type                   | When to Use                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dedicated Instance** | You need **hardware isolation**, but **don’t care** about licensing or placement. Simple compliance cases.                                |
| **Dedicated Host**     | You need **licensing control (BYOL)**, **visibility**, **placement**, or to **optimize costs** at scale. Best for enterprise-grade needs. |

Here's a **short, clear summary** of **Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka)**:

---

## 🔄 **Amazon MSK – Managed Kafka on AWS**

### 🔹 What It Is:

* **Fully managed Kafka service** on AWS
* Simplifies running **Apache Kafka clusters** (with brokers + Zookeeper)
* Deploys in **your VPC** across multiple **AZs** for high availability

### ⚙️ Key Features

| Feature            | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **MSK Standard**   | You manage scaling, AWS manages infra             |
| **MSK Serverless** | No servers to manage, auto-scales compute/storage |
| **EBS-backed**     | Data stored on durable EBS volumes                |
| **High retention** | Keep data for **months/years**, not just hours    |
| **TLS encryption** | Optional in-flight & at-rest encryption           |

### 🧠 Kafka Concepts in MSK

* **Producers** send events to **topics** (which have **partitions**)
* **Consumers** read events from those partitions
* Topics are **replicated across brokers** for fault tolerance

### 📡 MSK vs Kinesis Data Streams

| Feature       | MSK (Kafka)                | Kinesis Data Streams         |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Scaling       | Add partitions             | Split/merge shards           |
| Retention     | Custom (e.g., 1 year+)     | Default 24 hrs (up to 365d)  |
| Message size  | Up to 10 MB (configurable) | Max 1 MB                     |
| Consumer type | Pull-based                 | Push to Lambda (event-based) |
| Encryption    | TLS optional               | In-flight always enabled     |

### 🔌 How to Consume Data from MSK:

* ✅ Apache Flink (Kinesis Data Analytics for Flink)
* ✅ AWS Glue (streaming ETL)
* ✅ Lambda (as event source)
* ✅ Custom consumers (on EC2, ECS, EKS)

---

### ✅ Summary

**Amazon MSK = Kafka on AWS**

* **Fully managed**, scalable, highly available
* Works with AWS services like Glue, Flink, Lambda
* Serverless option removes infra management entirely

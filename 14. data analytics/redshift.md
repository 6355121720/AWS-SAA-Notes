Got it! Here's the **updated Redshift notes**, now including the **architecture in short** — appended at the right place:

---

## 🟥 **Amazon Redshift – Data Warehousing in AWS**

---

### 📌 What is Redshift?

* Fully managed **OLAP** data warehouse for analytics at scale.
* Uses **columnar storage**, compression, and **MPP** (Massively Parallel Processing).

---

### 🧱 Core Concepts

| Feature              | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Columnar storage** | Stores data by column for analytics performance  |
| **MPP**              | Work is distributed across multiple nodes        |
| **Snapshots**        | Automatic backups & cross-region restore support |

---

### 🏗️ **Architecture (Short)**

* Redshift cluster = **1 Leader Node + multiple Compute Nodes**
* **Leader Node**: Parses queries, plans execution, coordinates nodes
* **Compute Nodes**: Store data, execute tasks in parallel, return results
* Data is returned to client through the leader

---

### 💡 Use Cases

* Business Intelligence (BI)
* Dashboards & analytics
* Data lake integration

---

### 💰 Pricing

* Charged based on node type (e.g., RA3, DC2) and usage hours
* **Spectrum**: Pay per **TB scanned** from S3

---

## ⚡ **Redshift Spectrum**

> Query data directly in **S3** without loading it into Redshift.

---

### 🎯 When to Use

* Query **raw, archived, or external data in S3** using Redshift SQL
* Great for combining warehouse + data lake

---

### 🏗️ **Spectrum Architecture (Short)**

* Uses a **separate fleet of Spectrum nodes**
* **Leader Node** sends S3 query to Spectrum nodes
* Spectrum nodes read & filter S3 data, return to Redshift compute nodes
* **Compute Nodes**: Store data, execute tasks in parallel, return results
* Data is returned to client through the leader

---

### ✅ Benefits

* Serverless and scalable
* Works with partitioned, columnar S3 formats (Parquet, ORC)
* Uses **Glue Data Catalog** for schema definitions

### 🆚 Redshift vs Redshift Spectrum

| Feature         | Redshift                     | Redshift Spectrum                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Storage**     | Local (Redshift managed)     | External (S3)                        |
| **Performance** | Faster (local data)          | Slower (S3 scan on demand)           |
| **Pricing**     | Node-based                   | Per TB scanned                       |
| **Use Case**    | Core analytics, fast queries | Raw data analysis, low-touch queries |

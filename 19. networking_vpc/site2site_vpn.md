# 🔐 AWS Site-to-Site VPN, VGW, CGW & CloudHub — Full In-Depth Notes

---

## ✅ **What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN?**

Site-to-Site VPN is a secure **IPSec-encrypted connection** over the **public internet** that connects your **on-premises network** (or another AWS VPC) to your **AWS VPC**.

```
🏢 On-premises Network  🔁  🌐 Public Internet (IPSec)  🔁  ☁️ AWS VPC
```

* Managed by AWS and fully integrated with VPC networking.
* Creates a **virtual private tunnel** to route traffic securely.

---

## 🎯 **When to Use It**

* Hybrid cloud setup — you want AWS to integrate with your internal data center.
* Disaster recovery — AWS acts as your DR site.
* Quick VPN access without setting up Direct Connect.
* You have multiple branch offices that must communicate through AWS.
* You want to connect VPCs across **different AWS regions or accounts** (via VPN if TGW is not used).

## 🧱 **Core Components**

| Component                            | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟦 **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** | AWS side VPN endpoint; attach it to your VPC. Acts like a **VPN concentrator**. |
| 🟧 **Customer Gateway (CGW)**        | Your side: On-prem router, firewall, or software device that initiates VPN.     |

---

## 🔧 **How to Set Up a Site-to-Site VPN**

### 1️⃣ **Create VGW**

* Attach the **VGW** to your AWS VPC.

### 2️⃣ **Define CGW**

* Create a CGW in AWS console with:

  * Public IP address (your device or NAT IP)
  * ASN (for BGP dynamic routing)
  * Routing options: Static or Dynamic (BGP)

### 3️⃣ **Create VPN Connection**

* Link VGW ↔ CGW using:

  * Static or BGP routing
  * AWS generates **2 IPsec tunnels** (for high availability)

### 4️⃣ **Download Configuration**

* AWS provides **tunnel details**:

  * Outside IPs (AWS side)
  * Inside IPs (for BGP or static routes)
  * Pre-shared keys
  * Templates for Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper, etc.

### 5️⃣ **Configure Your Router (CGW)**

* Upload config or manually enter IPSec tunnel info.

---

## 🧭 **Routing: Route Table + Propagation**

To allow your VPC to reach on-prem:

* Go to the **VPC route table**
* Enable **route propagation** from the VGW
* Or manually add routes like:

```
Destination: 10.10.0.0/16 (on-prem subnet)
Target: virtual private gateway (VGW)
```

Without this, the VPN works, but VPC traffic won’t know where to go = ❌ broken communication.

---

## 🧪 **Allowing ICMP (Ping)**

To test the VPN using ping (`ICMP`):

| Resource           | Rule Needed                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| EC2 Security Group | Inbound rule: allow ICMP (type 8 - Echo)       |
| NACL (optional)    | Allow ICMP type 8 and 0 (Echo request + reply) |

> 🔒 By default, AWS blocks ICMP — must allow explicitly.

---

## 🌐 **Public IP Scenarios for CGW**

| Scenario         | What to Use                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Direct public IP | Use that IP in CGW setup                    |
| Behind NAT       | Use **NAT's public IP**, enable **NAT-T**   |
| Dynamic IP       | ❌ Not supported — must have fixed public IP |

---

## 🔄 **Static vs Dynamic (BGP) Routing**

| Mode    | How It Works                              | Pros                          | Use Case                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Static  | You define route CIDRs manually           | Simple, quick                 | Small networks, simple routing         |
| Dynamic | Uses BGP to exchange routes automatically | Scales better, route failover | CloudHub, branch offices, complex WANs |

> BGP is required for **CloudHub** and **VPN over Direct Connect**.

---

## 🕸️ **AWS VPN CloudHub (Advanced Topic)**

### ✅ What is CloudHub?

CloudHub is **not a separate AWS service**, but an **architecture pattern** that allows:

```
🏢 On-prem Branch 1 (CGW1)
    ↘
     🔐 VGW in AWS
    ↗
🏢 On-prem Branch 2 (CGW2)
```

**Multiple CGWs** (customer sites or branch offices) establish VPN tunnels to a **single VGW**. Once connected, they can communicate **with AWS and with each other**.

### 🧠 Think of it like:

A **hub-and-spoke** network with AWS VGW as the **hub**, and each on-prem site as a **spoke**.

---

### 📦 CloudHub Use Case

* Large enterprise with **many offices**
* Each has its own **firewall or VPN device**
* You want:

  * All offices to access AWS resources
  * AND securely talk to each other over AWS (even if no direct MPLS WAN exists)

---

### 🧰 CloudHub Setup

| Step                       | Details                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Multiple VPN connections | From each CGW to the **same VGW**                                         |
| ✅ Use BGP                  | For route exchange and failover support                                   |
| ✅ Route configuration      | Each branch advertises its CIDR via BGP; VGW learns and shares them       |
| 🔁 Routes shared           | VGW becomes a **route reflector**, forwarding branch A’s route to B, etc. |

---

## 🧩 Bonus: VPC-to-VPC VPN via VGW (Advanced Option)

You can also create VPN tunnels **between two AWS VPCs** using:

* A **VGW** in VPC A
* A **CGW** in VPC B (with a public IP or NAT IP)
* A **VPN Connection** between them

**Use case:** Cross-region VPC-to-VPC connectivity when TGW is not used, or between different AWS accounts.

| **Route Propagation** | Allows VPC route table to learn routes from VGW            |
| **CloudHub**          | Multi-site communication via AWS using BGP to a single VGW |
| **Ping/ICMP**         | Blocked by default; allow via Security Group & NACL        |
| **NAT-T**             | Required if CGW is behind NAT                              |

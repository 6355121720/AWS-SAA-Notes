# 🧱 AWS Network Firewall — Deep Dive

## 🔐 1. Why Do We Need It?

You've likely used:

* **Security Groups**: Instance-level traffic control (stateful, L4).
* **NACLs**: Subnet-level traffic control (stateless, L4).
* **WAF**: Protects against HTTP(S) attacks at the **application layer** (L7).
* **Shield & Shield Advanced**: DDoS protection.

But what if you want a **fully managed, VPC-wide firewall** that can:

* Inspect **all traffic** (even non-HTTP/S protocols)
* Apply **deep packet inspection (DPI)** up to Layer 7
* Work like a **stateful, central firewall for entire VPC traffic**

✅ That’s where **AWS Network Firewall** comes in — it’s your **enterprise-grade, managed network security solution**.

---

## 🚦 2. What It Protects (Traffic Coverage)

AWS Network Firewall can **filter and inspect traffic from all directions**:

| Traffic Direction     | Supported? | Example Use                           |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Inbound from Internet | ✅          | Block malicious IPs hitting ALBs      |
| Outbound to Internet  | ✅          | Block outbound to risky domains       |
| VPC-to-VPC (Peering)  | ✅          | Restrict internal lateral movement    |
| Site-to-Site VPN      | ✅          | Block specific protocols from on-prem |
| AWS Direct Connect    | ✅          | Prevent data exfiltration via DC      |

---

## ⚙️ 3. How It Works Internally

AWS Network Firewall uses **AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** behind the scenes:

```
           [Internet/VPN/DC/VPC]
                    ↓
             ┌──────────────────┐
             │  GWLB Endpoint   │
             │ (Managed by AWS) │
             └──────────────────┘
                    ↓
        ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │  AWS Network Firewall   │
        └─────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
              [Private Subnets]
```

✅ So **you don’t need to deploy third-party firewalls (like Palo Alto or Fortinet)** — AWS manages everything, and you **just define the rules**.

---

## 🧪 4. Features & Capabilities

### ✅ **Layer 3–7 Traffic Filtering**

You can filter traffic based on:

* **Source/Destination IP**
* **Port numbers**
* **Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)**
* **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)** — e.g., allow only `*.yourcompany.com`
* **Regex pattern matching** in packet payloads

### ✅ **Rule Action Types**

* `Allow`: Let the traffic through.
* `Drop`: Silently discard.
* `Alert`: Pass the traffic but **log and flag it**.

### ✅ **Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDPS)**

* Inspects **flow behavior** and known malicious patterns.
* Can **block known threats** (e.g., port scanning, exfiltration attempts).

### ✅ **High Performance at Scale**

* Supports **tens of thousands of rules**
* Built to scale horizontally across **AZs**

---

## 🛠 5. Configuration & Architecture

To deploy it:

1. Create **Firewall Policy** (rules)
2. Create **Firewall** (attach to VPC)
3. Associate with **Firewall Subnet** in each AZ
4. Update **Route Tables** to pass traffic through firewall endpoint

🧠 **Important**: AWS Network Firewall is not automatically in the path — **you must route traffic through it manually** using route tables.

---

## 🌐 6. Centralized Management

With **AWS Firewall Manager**, you can:

* Enforce consistent rules across **many accounts** and **VPCs**
* Integrate with **AWS Organizations**
* Use **policy-based management** (like SCPs for firewalls)

---

## 📊 7. Logging and Monitoring

You can send logs of matched rules to:

* **Amazon S3** – long-term archival
* **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** – for real-time dashboards and alerts
* **Kinesis Data Firehose** – for advanced analytics and SIEM integration

Example: Log every outbound request to suspicious domains for threat hunting.

| Restrict internal movement          | Filter VPC-to-VPC or subnet-to-subnet traffic |
| Enforce outbound policy compliance  | Allow traffic only to approved vendors/repos  |
| Threat detection logging            | Send logs to SIEM using Kinesis or S3         |

## 🧠 Exam Tip

> If a question mentions **deep packet inspection**, **stateful inspection**, or **domain-level filtering across VPCs**, the correct answer is **AWS Network Firewall** — **not NACLs, SGs, or WAF**.

---

## ✅ Final Takeaways

* **AWS Network Firewall = VPC-wide, fully managed, stateful firewall** with deep packet inspection.
* Works on **all directions**: VPC, internet, VPN, Direct Connect.
* Allows **regex, domain, port, IP filtering** at scale.
* Requires **routing traffic through it** via route tables.
* Central management via **AWS Firewall Manager**.
* Logs everything to **S3/CloudWatch/Kinesis** for visibility and compliance.

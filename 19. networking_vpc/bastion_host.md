Here's the **simplified and clear version** of the **Bastion Host concept**, with full real-world relevance for AWS and exam prep:

---

### 🔐 What is a Bastion Host?

A **Bastion Host** is a **secure gateway EC2 instance** placed in a **public subnet** that lets you SSH into EC2 instances located in **private subnets**.

Think of it like a **guarded door** to your private infrastructure. You **must pass through the Bastion Host** to access any private server.

---

### 🧠 Why Do We Need It?

* **Private Subnet = No direct internet access**
* Your laptop = On public internet
* So... you **can’t SSH directly** into a private EC2 instance

✅ **Solution**:
You SSH **first into the Bastion Host** (public),
then SSH from there into your **private EC2** instance.

### 📶 Flow of Access

```
[Your Laptop (public IP)]
         |
      SSH (22)
         ↓
[Bastion Host in Public Subnet]
         |
      SSH (22)
         ↓
[Private EC2 Instance in Private Subnet]
```

### ⚙️ Key Setup Components

#### 🔹 1. Bastion Host (Public Subnet)

* Has **Public IP**
* **Inbound SG Rule**:

  * Allow `SSH (port 22)`
  * Only **from your IP** (not `0.0.0.0/0`)
* **Outbound Rule**: Allow all (default)

#### 🔹 2. Private EC2 (Private Subnet)

* No public IP
* **Inbound SG Rule**:

  * Allow `SSH (port 22)`
  * Only **from Bastion Host’s SG**
* **Outbound Rule**: Allow all (default)

---

### 🔐 Security Best Practices

* ❌ Never allow `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH on bastion
* ✅ Only allow **your IP** or **corporate IP range**
* ✅ Use **key pairs or SSM Session Manager** for better control
* ✅ Consider **Auto Shutdown**, **Logging**, or **Session Recording**

### ✅ Key Exam Takeaways

| Feature                      | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**                  | Access private EC2s securely via SSH       |
| **Location**                 | Public Subnet                              |
| **Has Public IP?**           | Yes                                        |
| **Security Group (Inbound)** | SSH allowed **only from your IP**          |
| **Private EC2 SG (Inbound)** | SSH allowed **only from Bastion SG or IP** |
| **SSH Flow**                 | You → Bastion → Private EC2                |

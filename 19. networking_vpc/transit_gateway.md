# ✅ AWS Transit Gateway — Full Notes

## 🧭 The Problem: Complex VPC Networking

As AWS adoption grows, many organizations build:

* Multiple **VPCs**
* Across **multiple AWS accounts**
* In **multiple AWS Regions**
* Plus connectivity to **on-premises data centers**

Traditional approaches like **VPC peering**, **VPNs**, and **Direct Connect** create **complex, hard-to-scale** topologies:

* **Peering is non-transitive**: VPC-A ↔ VPC-B ↔ VPC-C requires manual links.
* Connecting each VPC to **Direct Connect** or **VPN** is costly and messy.

---

## 🧩 Transit Gateway Overview

**Transit Gateway (TGW)** is a fully managed, scalable **network hub** that:

* Enables **transitive routing** between **thousands of VPCs**, **on-premises**, and **remote networks**
* Operates in a **hub-and-spoke** (star) model
* Simplifies and centralizes network connectivity

> Think of TGW as a **regional Layer 3 router** managed by AWS.

## 🏗️ TGW Architecture

### 🔗 Connects:

* **Multiple VPCs** within the same region
* **Site-to-Site VPNs**
* **Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)**
* **On-premises networks**
* **Other Transit Gateways** (via TGW peering)

### 💡 Transitive Routing:

Once attached, all networks can communicate **through the TGW** — no need for individual VPC peering!

Example:

```
VPC-A ↔ TGW ↔ VPC-B ↔ TGW ↔ On-Prem
```

## 🧰 TGW Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transitive Routing**           | VPCs, VPNs, and DXGW connected via TGW can all communicate through it.              |
| **Route Tables**                 | TGW uses its own route tables to control which attachments can talk to each other.  |
| **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)** | Enables bandwidth scaling for VPNs.                                                 |
| **IP Multicast Support**         | Only AWS service supporting multicast (for real-time apps like video distribution). |
| **Cross-Account Sharing**        | Use **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)** to share TGW across AWS accounts.         |
| **Inter-Region Peering**         | TGWs can be peered across regions for global connectivity.                          |
| **Supports DXGW**                | Attach Direct Connect Gateway to TGW and reach multiple VPCs and regions.           |

## 📡 VPN Bandwidth Scaling with ECMP

### 🔄 VPN Bandwidth Limits:

| Type       | Max Bandwidth                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| VPN to VGW | 1.5 Gbps (1 active tunnel)     |
| VPN to TGW | 2.5 Gbps (both tunnels active) |

### 📈 Scale with Multiple VPNs

Using **ECMP**, you can create **multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections** to TGW to scale throughput:

| # of VPNs | Tunnels | Total Bandwidth |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 2       | 2.5 Gbps        |
| 2         | 4       | 5 Gbps          |
| 3         | 6       | 7.5 Gbps        |

> This is not possible with traditional VGW!

## 🚀 Direct Connect + TGW Integration

### Traditional DX Model:

* Create multiple **private VIFs** to connect each VPC or VGW — hard to scale.

### TGW Model:

* One DX connects to a **Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)**
* DXGW connects to **Transit Gateway**
* TGW connects to **multiple VPCs**

✅ **Result**: One DX → multiple VPCs (in same or different accounts/regions)

---

## 🌍 Cross-Account, Cross-Region Capabilities

* **Accounts**: Use **RAM** to allow other accounts to attach VPCs to your TGW.
* **Regions**: TGWs can peer across regions, enabling **global network connectivity**.

---

## 🔁 Routing Control in TGW

Transit Gateway has **its own route tables** (separate from VPC route tables):

* You can **control which attachments can talk** to each other by defining routes in TGW RTs.
* Example:

  * VPC-A and VPC-B attached to TGW
  * If VPC-A’s route table in TGW doesn’t point to VPC-B, they **can’t talk**

---

## 📢 IP Multicast Support

TGW is the **only AWS service** that supports **IP Multicast** — used for:

* Video streaming
* Real-time financial data
* Software updates in distributed systems

💡 Multicast traffic **does not route outside the region**, and **not supported with VPN or DX**.

## 💡 Key Benefits of Transit Gateway

| Feature               | Benefit                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Transitive Routing    | Full-mesh without individual peering          |
| Bandwidth Scaling     | ECMP over VPN increases throughput            |
| Simplified Management | One central hub to manage all connections     |
| Cross-Account Sharing | Use RAM to attach VPCs from other accounts    |
| Scalable              | Supports thousands of VPCs                    |
| Centralized Security  | Use route tables + NACLs to enforce isolation |
| Multicast Support     | Native multicast for real-time use cases      |

## 🧪 Exam Tips

* TGW supports **transitive routing**, **multicast**, and **ECMP** — VGW does **not**.
* Use **TGW + DXGW** for **cross-account or cross-region DX** access.
* Use **TGW + VPN + ECMP** for scalable bandwidth beyond 1.5 Gbps.
* Use **TGW Route Tables** to **control communication scope**.

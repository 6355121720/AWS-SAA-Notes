Sure! Here's the simplified and structured version of the **Internet Gateways & Route Tables** overview in my style:

## 🌐 Internet Gateway & Route Table — Overview

To allow your AWS resources (like EC2) to access the **internet**, you need two things:

1. An **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
2. A **Route Table** that points traffic to it

---

### 🔹 What is an Internet Gateway (IGW)?

| Property               | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Enables internet access for resources inside a VPC                    |
| **Scalability**        | Fully **managed**, **highly available**, and **scales automatically** |
| **One per VPC**        | A VPC can have **only 1 IGW attached** at a time                      |
| **One-to-one mapping** | IGW ↔ VPC (not shared across VPCs)                                    |

📌 **Important:** Just attaching an IGW does **not** give internet access.

### 🔸 How to Enable Internet Access

To make a subnet **public**, you need:

1. ✅ **Attach IGW to VPC**
2. ✅ **Update Route Table**:

   * Add a route:

     ```
     Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 → Target: Internet Gateway
     ```
3. ✅ **Enable “Auto-assign Public IP”** on the subnet

Now, EC2 in that subnet will have:

* A **public IP**
* A route to the internet

---

### 🔐 Public vs Private Subnet

| Subnet Type | Route Table Entry for Internet | Public IP?       | Internet Access                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Public**  | 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW                | Yes              | ✅ Yes                           |
| **Private** | No route to IGW                | No (or NAT only) | ❌ No (or only outbound via NAT) |

---

### ✅ Summary

* **IGW** is needed for VPC → Internet communication
* IGW must be **attached** to the VPC
* Internet access requires a **route in the Route Table**
* Only **subnets with public IPs + route to IGW** are truly *public subnets*

Here's your **VPC Section Summary** rewritten in **my structured, deep-dive style** — for clarity, quick recall, and future-proof note-taking:

---

# 🧠 AWS VPC — Full Section Summary (Refined & In-Depth)

---

## 🌍 **1. VPC & CIDR Fundamentals**

* **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** defines **IP address ranges**, e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`.
* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is your **isolated cloud network**, supporting:

  * **IPv4** (private by default)
  * **IPv6** (public by default, globally unique)

---

## 🧱 **2. Subnets & Availability Zones**

* A **subnet** = A portion of the VPC CIDR, **tied to a single AZ**.
* Two types:

  * **Public Subnet** → can reach the internet directly.
  * **Private Subnet** → isolated from direct internet access.
* IPv6 must be explicitly enabled at both VPC and subnet levels.

---

## 🌐 **3. Internet Access**

### 🔹 **Public Subnet Setup**

* Must have:

  * An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** attached to the VPC.
  * A **route table entry** (`0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`) pointing to the IGW.
  * EC2 with public IP or Elastic IP.

### 🔹 **Private Subnet Setup**

* No IGW route.
* For outbound internet (IPv4):

  * Use **NAT Gateway** (recommended) or **NAT Instance** (legacy).
* For outbound IPv6:

  * Use **Egress-Only Internet Gateway** (acts like NAT for IPv6).

---

## 🧭 **4. Route Tables**

* Define how **traffic flows** within your VPC.
* Can route to:

  * **IGW**
  * **NAT Gateway**
  * **VPC Peering**
  * **VPC Endpoints**
  * **Transit Gateway**
* Each subnet must be associated with one route table.

## 🔐 **5. Security Mechanisms**

| Feature        | NACL (Network ACL)         | Security Group        |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Scope          | Subnet-level               | Instance-level        |
| Stateful?      | ❌ Stateless                | ✅ Stateful            |
| Rules          | Allow & Deny               | Only Allow            |
| Return Traffic | Must be explicitly allowed | Automatically allowed |

💡 **Ephemeral ports** (1024–65535) must be considered in NACLs for response traffic.

---

## 🛡️ **6. Bastion Host**

* A **public EC2** in a public subnet.
* Used to **SSH into private EC2s** via internal IPs.
* Acts as a **secure jump box**.

---

## 🔄 **7. NAT Instances vs NAT Gateway**

| Feature        | NAT Gateway             | NAT Instance           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Managed        | ✅ AWS-managed           | ❌ Manual               |
| Scalability    | ✅ Auto-scalable         | ❌ Manual resizing      |
| IPv6 Support   | ❌ (Use Egress-Only IGW) | ❌                      |
| Use Case Today | ✅ Recommended           | ❌ Deprecated           |
| AZ Redundancy  | ❌ Per-AZ                | ❌ Must manage manually |

---

## 🔗 **8. VPC Peering**

* Connects **two VPCs** with **non-overlapping CIDRs**.
* **Non-transitive** → No routing between peered peers.
* Manual route table updates required in **both VPCs**.

---

## 🔌 **9. VPC Endpoints (Private AWS Service Access)**

| Type      | Used For                 | Internet Needed? | Underlying Tech       |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Gateway   | S3, DynamoDB             | ❌ No             | Route Table + Gateway |
| Interface | Other AWS services (SSM) | ❌ No             | ENI + DNS Mapping     |

* Keeps traffic within AWS — **secure and cost-effective**.

---

## 🧾 **10. VPC Flow Logs**

* Capture **metadata** about network traffic.
* Can log at:

  * **VPC level**
  * **Subnet level**
  * **ENI level**
* Stored in:

  * **CloudWatch Logs** (real-time analysis)
  * **S3 + Athena** (query-based analysis)

---

## 🧷 **11. Hybrid Connectivity (On-Prem to AWS)**

### 🛰️ **Site-to-Site VPN**

* **IPSec VPN tunnel** over public internet.
* Components:

  * **VGW** (Virtual Private Gateway) — AWS side
  * **CGW** (Customer Gateway) — on-premises device
* Use **VPN CloudHub** to interconnect **multiple VPNs** to one VGW.

### ⚙️ **Direct Connect**

* **Dedicated fiber link** from your data center to AWS.
* Offers:

  * **Low latency**
  * **No internet traversal**
* Requires:

  * A physical connection to a **DX location**.
  * Optionally connected to multiple VPCs via **DX Gateway**.

---

## 🔄 **12. Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)**

* One DX → connect to **multiple VPCs across regions**.
* **Decouples** VPC-region dependency from DX.

---

## 📡 **13. PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)**

* Expose your service (behind NLB) **privately** to other VPCs/accounts.
* No:

  * IGW
  * NAT
  * Route Table config
  * Peering
* Uses:

  * **ENIs** in consumer VPCs
  * Backed by **NLB** in provider VPC
* Great for **SaaS providers** or **internal microservices**.

---

## 🔁 **14. Transit Gateway (TGW)**

* **Routing hub** for VPCs, VPNs, DX.
* Supports **transitive routing** (unlike peering).
* Simplifies network topologies in **multi-VPC architectures**.

---

## 👁️ **15. Traffic Mirroring**

* **Packet-level** traffic replication.
* Use case: intrusion detection, packet analysis.
* Source: **ENI**
* Target: **Monitoring appliances** (via NLB or EC2)

---

## 🌐 **16. IPv6 in VPC**

* Must be explicitly enabled at VPC & subnet level.
* **Public by default** — globally routable.
* For **outbound-only access**: use **Egress-Only IGW** (acts like NAT for IPv6).
* **No NAT Gateway support** for IPv6.

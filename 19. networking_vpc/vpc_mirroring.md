## 🪞 **VPC Traffic Mirroring – Explained**

### ✅ What Is It?

> **VPC Traffic Mirroring** lets you **capture and analyze live network traffic** from EC2 instances in your VPC — **without interrupting** the original traffic flow.
> It can help you analayze whole package, not just src, dest etc. It gives you whole packet.

🔍 Think of it like a **wiretap for your cloud traffic**, used for:

* Security inspection
* Threat detection
* Performance analysis

---

## 🧱 How It Works

```
Source A ─────[Mirrored via ENI]─────> Network Load Balancer
Source B ─────[Mirrored via ENI]─────> Network Load Balancer
                                         │
                                         ↓
                           Auto Scaling group ───> EC2 Instances

Traffic Mirroring ───[Filtered Traffic]───> Security Appliances
```


---

## 🛠️ Configuration Steps

1. 🎯 **Select Source ENIs** – Which EC2 instances' traffic to monitor
2. 🎯 **Choose Target** – Where mirrored packets go:

   * Another ENI (e.g., EC2 running Suricata/Snort)
   * Network Load Balancer → Auto Scaling group of analyzer EC2s
3. 🧹 **(Optional) Add Filters** – Capture only certain traffic (e.g., port 443, HTTP, etc.)

---

## 🔁 Multi-Source Support

✅ You can mirror from **multiple ENIs** across instances:

* Centralizes traffic inspection into a **single NLB**
* Makes it easier to monitor **entire subnets or tiers** of your application

## 🌐 VPC Peering Support

| Source & Target Location    | Supported? |
| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Same VPC                    | ✅ Yes      |
| Different VPC (via peering) | ✅ Yes      |
| Cross-region / transit VPCs | ❌ No       |

> Both source and target must be **in the same AZ** and **within the same or peered VPCs**.

## 🔍 Use Cases

| Use Case              | Purpose                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🛡️ Threat Detection  | Send traffic to IDS/IPS tools like Snort |
| 🧪 Content Inspection | Monitor for data exfiltration or malware |
| 🛠️ Troubleshooting   | Analyze app latency or packet loss       |
| 🔍 Compliance Audit   | Keep logs for regulated environments     |

## ✅ Key Takeaways

| Topic                   | Details                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-Intrusive**       | Traffic is copied, original stays unaffected |
| **Targets**             | ENIs, Network Load Balancer                  |
| **Sources**             | One or more ENIs                             |
| **Traffic Filtering**   | Optional packet filtering to reduce noise    |
| **Same AZ/VPC Peering** | Supported (not cross-region)                 |

### 🧠 Final Insight:

> VPC Traffic Mirroring gives deep **visibility into packet-level activity** inside your VPC — essential for advanced **cloud security**, **forensics**, and **monitoring** in production.

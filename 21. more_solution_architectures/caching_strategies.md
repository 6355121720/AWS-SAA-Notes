## üîÅ AWS Caching Strategies ‚Äî Clean Architecture Walkthrough

### üß≠ Overview

In AWS, caching can happen at **three levels**:

1. **Edge (CloudFront)**
2. **Regional (API Gateway)**
3. **App-level (Redis/Memcached/DAX)**

Each level reduces load and latency at different stages in the request pipeline.

### ‚ö° 1. CloudFront (Edge Caching)

* **Location:** Global Edge Locations (CDN)
* **Use Case:** Static websites, APIs, S3-hosted assets
* **Why:** Serve content *close to user* ‚Üí lower latency
* **How:**

  * CloudFront caches content from origin (S3, API Gateway, etc.)
  * Set **TTL (Time-To-Live)** to control freshness.
* **Trade-off:** Super fast but might return stale data if TTL is high.

‚úÖ Best for: static content, assets (JS, CSS, images), API GET calls

---

### üåé 2. API Gateway Caching (Regional)

* **Location:** In the AWS region (closer to backend)
* **Use Case:** Repeated API responses (like `GET /user/123`)
* **Why:** Avoid re-computation in backend; faster for users
* **How:**

  * Enable cache per method (like GET endpoints)
  * You choose TTL
* **Trade-off:** Not global; only helps within that AWS region

‚úÖ Best for: reducing backend load, speeding up repeat API calls

---

### üß† 3. Application-Level Caching (Logic/DB Layer)

* **Location:** Inside or near your app (EC2/Lambda)
* **Tools:** Redis, Memcached, or **Amazon DAX** (for DynamoDB)
* **Why:** Offload database by caching expensive or frequent queries
* **How:**

  * App logic checks cache before DB
  * If not found ‚Üí query DB ‚Üí store in cache
* **Trade-off:** Needs custom logic & cache eviction strategies

‚úÖ Best for: high-read DB queries, real-time apps, session caching

### üß© Considerations:

| Question                        | Cache Layer              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Want global fast delivery?      | CloudFront               |
| Want to cache API responses?    | API Gateway              |
| Want to avoid hitting DB?       | Redis/DAX                |
| Need dynamic TTL control?       | App-level                |
| Need auto-scaling + low effort? | CloudFront + API Gateway |

### üîë Summary:

| Layer       | Speed      | Scope        | Best Use                         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| CloudFront  | üî• Fastest | Global       | Static/GET APIs                  |
| API Gateway | ‚ö° Fast     | Regional     | Frequently called APIs           |
| Redis/DAX   | ‚ö° Fast     | App-internal | DB-heavy apps, real-time systems |

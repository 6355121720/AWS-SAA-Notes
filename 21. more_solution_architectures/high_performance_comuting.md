Here‚Äôs a **clear, complete breakdown** of **High Performance Computing (HPC) on AWS**, in my signature style ‚Äî no fluff, just clean structure, deep clarity, and real-world value.

## üß† What is HPC (High Performance Computing)?

**HPC** = using **lots of computing power (CPU/GPU + fast network + parallel processing)** to solve very **complex, heavy computations** in less time.

üìå **Why AWS is perfect for HPC**:

* You can spin up **100s or 1000s of EC2 instances** in minutes.
* You pay **only for what you use** (no on-prem hardware costs).
* You can **tear everything down** when done.
* Great for **burst computing** ‚Äî short but intense jobs.

## üóÉÔ∏è 1. Data Management & Transfer

Before computing, you need your **huge datasets** in AWS.

| Tool                    | Purpose                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Direct Connect**  | High-speed private network to AWS (Gbps scale)                             |
| **Snowball/Snowmobile** | Physical device to transfer **TB‚ÄìPB of data** (good for huge cold storage) |
| **AWS DataSync**        | Fast, automated on-prem to AWS transfer (supports NFS, SMB)                |

## üßÆ 2. Compute & Networking (HPC Core)

### üöÄ EC2 Instances

* Use **compute-optimized (C5, C7g)** or **GPU (P4, G5)** instances.
* Use **Spot Instances/Fleets** for 70‚Äì90% cost savings.

### üì¶ Placement Groups (Cluster Type)

* Puts all EC2s **on the same rack** and **same AZ**.
* Enables **low latency, high bandwidth** inter-instance comms (10‚Äì100 Gbps).
* Must use for **parallel/distributed computing**.

### ‚ö° Enhanced Networking

To reduce latency and improve packets/sec:

| Option                            | Max Speed          | Notes                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **ENA (Elastic Network Adapter)** | Up to **100 Gbps** | Most modern EC2s support this |
| **VF (Intel 82599)**              | Up to **10 Gbps**  | Older, legacy                 |

### üßµ Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)

* **Advanced networking interface** for **Linux** HPC.
* Uses **MPI** (Message Passing Interface).
* Bypasses Linux OS kernel ‚Üí even lower latency.
* Ideal for **tightly coupled parallel computing** (where all nodes constantly talk).

## üß± 3. Storage Options for HPC

### Instance-Attached Storage

| Type                           | Performance            | Notes                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **EBS (io2 Block Express)**    | Up to **256,000 IOPS** | Persistent, block storage                         |
| **Instance Store (ephemeral)** | **Millions of IOPS**   | Blazing fast, but **data lost if instance stops** |

### Network-Based Storage

| Type               | Notes                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3**             | Object storage, scalable, not for live file access                          |
| **EFS**            | NFS, scalable file system; IOPS based on size unless using provisioned mode |
| **FSx for Lustre** | ‚ö° HPC-optimized file system, **Linux only**, integrates with S3             |

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Batch**           | Run large-scale **batch jobs** (e.g. image rendering, simulations). Can span across multiple EC2s.                    |
| **AWS ParallelCluster** | Open-source tool to **deploy and manage HPC clusters**. Creates VPC, subnet, EC2s, auto-scales. EFA support built-in. |

## üîç Exam Tips

1. **EFA = tightly coupled, Linux, MPI workloads**.
2. **Placement Group (Cluster) = low latency between EC2s**.
3. **FSx for Lustre = HPC-optimized shared file system**.
4. **Snowball/Snowmobile = huge data ingestion** before HPC run.
5. **Batch vs ParallelCluster**:

   * Batch = Job-level scheduling (run jobs).
   * ParallelCluster = Full-blown HPC cluster setup.

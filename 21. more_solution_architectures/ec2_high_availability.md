Here’s a clean, deeply **structured and practical** summary of **EC2 High Availability (HA)** — crafted for long-term revision and real-life implementation.

### 🧠 EC2 Instance High Availability (HA): Complete Strategy Guide

By default, a single EC2 instance is **not** highly available — it lives in one Availability Zone (AZ). If that AZ fails, so does the instance.

We can architect **multiple failover strategies** to ensure availability.

---

## 🛠️ Option 1: Elastic IP + Standby EC2 Instance

### ✅ Use Case

Simple app (e.g. web server) that must stay online with minimal infrastructure.

### 🧱 Architecture

```
[Elastic IP] 🔁  ➡  [Active EC2] (AZ-a)
                      ⬇
              [Standby EC2] (AZ-b)
```

### ⚙️ Workflow

1. Attach **Elastic IP** to the primary EC2.
2. Monitor health with **CloudWatch Alarm/Event** (e.g., CPU 100% or termination).
3. If failure is detected:

   * **Trigger Lambda**
   * Lambda **starts standby instance**
   * Lambda **re-attaches Elastic IP** to standby

### 🔐 Requirements

* Lambda needs IAM permissions to manage EC2 and Elastic IP.
* Both EC2s should have the same AMI/config (manual sync or baked image).

## ⚙️ Option 2: Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Across AZs

### ✅ Use Case

Want full **automation** of failover without Lambda.

### 🧱 Architecture

```
        +------------------+
        |   Auto Scaling   |
        | min=1 max=1      |
        | across 2 AZs     |
        +------------------+
                |
            [EC2 Instance]
                |
          User Data script
         attaches Elastic IP
```

### ⚙️ Workflow

* ASG launches 1 EC2 in any AZ.
* If instance fails, ASG **auto-launches a new one** in another AZ.
* EC2 **user data** script attaches Elastic IP using EC2 metadata + tagging.

### 🔐 Requirements

* EC2 must have **instance role** with `ec2:AssociateAddress`, etc.
* User Data script must use AWS CLI or SDK to perform attachment.

---

## 💾 Stateful EC2 with EBS Volumes

EBS volumes are AZ-scoped — so this needs extra logic.

### 🔄 Pattern

1. **ASG lifecycle hook** on instance termination:

   * Take snapshot of EBS volume
   * Tag snapshot with ASG metadata
2. **ASG lifecycle hook** on instance launch:

   * Create EBS from snapshot (in new AZ)
   * Attach it to new EC2
3. EC2 user data script:

   * Mount EBS volume
   * Attach Elastic IP

### 🧠 Note

This design provides:

* **Stateless failover** for web apps
* **Stateful failover** for data-bound apps like DBs

## 🔑 Summary

| Feature                | Elastic IP + Standby | Auto Scaling Group | Stateful (EBS) ASG |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| AZ-level HA            | ✅                    | ✅                  | ✅                  |
| Fully automated        | ❌ (needs Lambda)     | ✅                  | ✅ (with hooks)     |
| Stateful support (EBS) | ❌                    | ❌                  | ✅                  |
| Simpler setup          | ✅                    | ⚠️                 | ❌ (advanced)       |
| Elastic IP failover    | ✅                    | ✅ (via script)     | ✅ (via script)     |

### 🧩 Final Thoughts

* Elastic IP gives **consistency** to external users.
* ASG + Elastic IP gives **seamless self-healing**.
* Lifecycle hooks enable **true multi-AZ stateful failover** (critical for DBs).
* Everything depends on **proper IAM roles**, tagging strategy, and automation scripts.

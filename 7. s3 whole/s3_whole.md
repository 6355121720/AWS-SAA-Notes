## üì¶ 1. S3 Storage Classes (Organized by Use Case & Cost)

| Class                    | Use Case                                            | Availability | Durability            | Retrieval Time   | Pricing (example, US East)    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Standard**             | Frequently accessed data                            | 99.99%       | 11 9s (99.999999999%) | Milliseconds     | \~\$0.023/GB/month            |

> üí° Use lifecycle policies to move data across classes as it ages.

## üö¶ 2. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

* **CORS** is a **browser security feature**.
* It restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain (origin) unless explicitly allowed.
* For example, a web app at `myapp.com` cannot call an API at `api.com` unless `api.com` allows it via CORS headers.
* **Only affects browser-based requests**.
* Backend services (e.g., using curl, Postman, Lambda) are **not impacted**.

‚úÖ To enable CORS:

* Set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the S3 bucket or CloudFront.

## üîê 3. Encryption in S3

### Types of Encryption:

| Type                  | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Encryption at Rest    | Protects data stored in S3 using AES-256 or AWS KMS.  |
| Encryption in Transit | Secures data using SSL/TLS protocols during transfer. |
| Symmetric Encryption  | Same key is used for encryption & decryption.         |
| Asymmetric Encryption | Public-private key pair used.                         |

---

### Server-Side Encryption (SSE):

| SSE Type | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SSE-S3   | Keys managed by S3 (AES-256 encryption).         |
| SSE-KMS  | Uses AWS KMS for more control and audit logging. |
| SSE-C    | You provide and manage your encryption keys.     |

---

### Client-Side Encryption (CSE):

* You encrypt data **before uploading to S3**.
* AWS never sees plaintext or keys.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è 4. S3 Object Key & Prefixes

An object key may look like:

```
logs/2025/07/20/log1.txt
```

Here, `logs/2025/07/20/` is the **prefix**.

S3 uses **prefixes to route and scale requests internally**.

---

## üöÄ 5. Performance Scaling with Prefixes

### üîç What it means:

* S3 auto-scales, but performance is optimized **per prefix**.
* Older limitations (\~2018) caused throttling under a single prefix. Now, S3 supports high throughput per prefix.

### üí° Current Throughput Limits (Per Prefix):

* **3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests/sec**
* **5,500 GET/HEAD requests/sec**

Using **multiple prefixes increases parallelism**:

| Prefix          | GET/sec    |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| `logs/2025/07/` | 5,500      |
| `logs/2025/08/` | 5,500      |
| `logs/2025/09/` | 5,500      |
| **Total**       | **16,500** |

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

* Use **timestamp-based prefixes** (e.g., `logs/YYYY/MM/DD/`).
* Use **randomized or hashed prefixes** (e.g., `a1/`, `b2/`) for large-scale ingestion.
* Avoid dumping all data into a single prefix like `logs/`.

---

## üì• 6. Byte-Range Fetches

* Retrieve only **a portion of an object** (by byte range).
* Ideal for:

  * Resumable downloads
  * Large file access
  * Video/audio streaming
  * Parallel downloads

---

## üìä 7. S3 Storage Lens

* **Dashboard for S3 usage & cost optimization**.
* Features:

  * Analytics across all buckets/accounts.
  * Visual reports on access patterns, object age, lifecycle policies.
  * Security and performance insights.

---

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 8. S3 Multi-Part Upload

### Use Case:

* For files **‚â•100MB**, AWS recommends multi-part upload.

### Benefits:

* Splits large files into parts and uploads in **parallel**.
* Handles **network interruptions** gracefully.
* Improves upload speed and reliability.

---

## üåê 9. S3 Transfer Acceleration

### Description:

* Speeds up uploads/downloads over **long distances or high-latency networks**.

### How:

* Uses **Amazon CloudFront‚Äôs edge locations** to route data faster.
* Ideal for users **uploading to S3 from different regions**.

---

## üîÑ 10. S3 Lifecycle Policies

Automate object transitions to cheaper storage or deletion.

### Examples:

* Move to **Glacier** after 30 days.
* **Delete objects** after 90 days.

Saves cost and improves data lifecycle efficiency.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 11. S3 Baseline Performance

* S3 automatically scales with traffic.
* Per prefix:

  * **3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE**
  * **5,500 GET/HEAD** requests/sec
* **No limit on total prefixes per bucket**.

---

## üìÅ 12. Bucket Organization & Prefix Optimization

* **No limit** on number of prefixes.
* Best Practice: **create logical folder structures** using prefixes.
* Example:

  ```
  /logs/year/month/day/
  /images/campaign1/
  /data/batch01/
  ```

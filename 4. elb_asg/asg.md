Great! I’ve read your handwritten notes — they’re well-structured. Let's now give you a **full, clean, and in-depth explanation** of **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** in AWS with everything you need to know, step-by-step.

## ✅ **AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) – Full In-Depth Explanation**

---

### 🔹 What is ASG?

**Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** is an AWS feature that:

* Automatically **launches or terminates EC2 instances** based on demand.
* Ensures high **availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **cost efficiency**.
* Maintains a **desired number of instances** across **Availability Zones**.

### 📦 **Core Components of ASG**:

| Component                                       | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Launch Template** or **Launch Configuration** | Blueprint of how to launch EC2 instances (AMI, instance type, key pair, etc.) |
| **Minimum Size**                                | Minimum number of instances to maintain                                       |
| **Maximum Size**                                | Max allowed instances (upper bound)                                           |
| **Desired Capacity**                            | Target number of instances ASG should maintain                                |
| **Scaling Policies**                            | Rules to add/remove instances based on metrics or schedule                    |
| **Health Check Type**                           | AWS monitors instance health (EC2 or ELB health check)                        |
| **Lifecycle Hooks**                             | Pause scaling process for tasks like configuration or logging                 |

### 🔄 **Types of Auto Scaling**

There are **four types** of scaling strategies under ASG:

---

#### 1. **Dynamic Scaling (Real-time, metric-based)**

**→ Reacts automatically to CloudWatch metrics** like CPU, memory, network, etc.

##### a. Simple Scaling:

* One rule: e.g., CPU > 70% → add 1 instance
* Cooldown period before next scaling action

##### b. Step Scaling:

* Multiple steps for smarter control:

  * CPU > 70% → add 1 instance
  * CPU > 85% → add 2 instances
  * CPU < 40% → remove 1 instance
* More efficient and **prevents over-scaling**

##### c. Target Tracking Scaling:

* Works like a thermostat.
* Example: “Keep average CPU at 50%”
  ASG adds/removes instances to meet that target

##### d. Predictive Scaling (AI-driven):

* Uses **machine learning** to analyze **historical usage**
* **Predicts future demand** and scales in advance
* Best for **scheduled, cyclical workloads** (e.g., traffic spikes at 9 AM daily)

---

#### 2. **Scheduled Scaling (Time-based)**

* Scale based on **known traffic patterns**
* Example:

  * Add 5 instances at 9 AM
  * Remove 5 at 10 PM

---

### 🔁 **Termination Policies**

Controls **which instance to terminate** when scaling down.

Examples:

* Oldest launch template
* Closest to next billing hour
* Across AZs to balance

---

### ⏳ **De-registration Delay** (a.k.a Connection Draining)

* Time ASG **waits before removing** an instance from a load balancer
* Default: 300 seconds
* Allows in-flight requests to complete gracefully

---

### ⚙️ **Health Checks**

* ASG uses **EC2 status** or **ELB health checks**
* Unhealthy instances are automatically replaced

---

### 🔒 **Lifecycle Hooks**

* Pause before instance launch/terminate
* Use it to:

  * Run scripts
  * Install software
  * Send notifications (e.g., to SNS or Lambda)

---

### 🏗️ Real-World Architecture Example:

```
User → ALB → Auto Scaling Group → EC2 instances across 2 AZs
               ↑           ↑
          Scaling Policy   Launch Template
```

---

### 🧠 Best Practices:

* **Use target tracking** as default (simplest + powerful)
* **Combine with ELB** for balanced traffic
* Spread across **multiple AZs** for high availability
* Use **lifecycle hooks** for blue/green deployments
* Enable **detailed CloudWatch monitoring**

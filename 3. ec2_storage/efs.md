# üìò Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) ‚Äì In Depth

---

## üßæ What is EFS?

> **Amazon EFS** is a **fully managed, scalable, elastic, shared file system** that multiple EC2 instances can mount **simultaneously**. It behaves like a **network file share (NFS)** and automatically grows/shrinks as you add or delete files.

| Feature       | Detail                                                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type          | Network File System (POSIX-compliant)                                                              |
| Interface     | **NFSv4.1 or NFSv4.0**                                                                             |
| Scaling       | **Auto-scales from MBs to petabytes**                                                              |
| Access        | Shared across **multiple AZs** and EC2s                                                            |

| Pricing       | Pay-per-use (based on GB and throughput mode)                                                      |
| Ideal Use     | Web content, home directories, machine learning, shared storage for containers and serverless apps |

## üöÄ Throughput Modes (EFS)

Your notes cover this well. Let's structure and expand:

### 1. **Bursting Mode (Default)**

| Feature          | Detail                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Scales with size | Yes (Throughput = 50 MB/s per TB stored)            |
| Burst Limit      | **Up to 100 MB/s per TB**                           |
| Credits          | Like burst credits ‚Äî accumulate when under baseline |
| Use Case         | Most workloads with variable usage                  |

---

### 2. **Provisioned Throughput**

| Feature                     | Detail                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manually specify throughput | Yes                                                                                                              |
| Storage-independent         | Yes (not tied to size)                                                                                           |
| Use Case                    | High performance apps that need steady throughput regardless of storage size (e.g., analytics, CI/CD, streaming) |

### 3. **Elastic Throughput Mode (NEW, Recommended)**

| Feature                     | Detail                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-scales based on demand | ‚úÖ No provisioning or bursting                                    |
| Pricing                     | Pay-as-you-use throughput                                        |
| Use Case                    | **Unpredictable, spiky workloads** like AI/ML, analytics, Lambda |
| Advantage                   | No need to manage throughput at all                              |

‚úÖ Best option for modern cloud-native, serverless, or multi-user applications.

## üí∞ Pricing Model

1. **Storage Cost**: Per GB/month for both Standard and IA
2. **Throughput Cost**: Based on mode (provisioned, elastic, etc.)
3. **Requests**: Read/Write/Metadata operations
4. **Data Transfer**: Free within same region/VPC

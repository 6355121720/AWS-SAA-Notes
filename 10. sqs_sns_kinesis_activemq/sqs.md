# ✅ AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service) — Full In-Depth Notes

## 🔷 What is SQS?

**Amazon SQS** is a **fully managed message queuing service** that enables **asynchronous communication** between distributed components and microservices.
It acts as a **temporary message buffer**, helping systems exchange messages **without being directly connected** — enabling decoupled, scalable, and fault-tolerant architectures.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Producer sends a message** to the SQS queue (a REST-based API call).
2. **SQS stores the message** redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (A Highly Durable Service).
3. A **Consumer polls the queue** and retrieves the message.
4. The **message is hidden** from other consumers (Visibility Timeout).
5. After successful processing, the **consumer deletes the message** from the queue.

This ensures messages are processed **at least once**, or **exactly once** (with FIFO), depending on the queue type.

## 📦 Types of SQS Queues

### 1. **Standard Queue** (default)

* **Use case**: Most general-purpose applications
* **Characteristics**:

  * **High throughput** (nearly unlimited)
  * **At least once delivery** (can result in **duplicates**)
  * **Best-effort ordering**, but **not guaranteed**
* ✅ Ideal for tasks where exact order doesn’t matter (e.g., image processing, email sending)

### 2. **FIFO Queue** (First-In-First-Out)

* **Use case**: Applications where **order matters**
* **Characteristics**:

  * **Strict message ordering**
  * **Exactly-once processing** (no duplicates)
  * **Limited throughput**: 300 messages/sec without batching, 3000 with batching
* ✅ Ideal for financial transactions, inventory updates, or workflows where **message sequence matters**

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ **Visibility Timeout**

* Prevents **duplicate processing**.
* Once a message is received, it's hidden from other consumers for a set time.
* If the consumer fails to delete it in time, it becomes visible again.

### ✅ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**

* Used to capture **failed messages** (messages that couldn’t be processed after multiple retries).
* Helps in **debugging and isolating** problematic data.
* You can define a **maxReceiveCount** after which messages go to DLQ.

### ✅ **Long Polling**

* Reduces the cost and inefficiency of **frequent empty API calls**.
* Instead of constantly polling, the consumer waits for up to 20 seconds until a message arrives.
* Increases **efficiency** and **reduces costs**.

---

## 💡 Additional Key Concepts

### 🔸 Message Retention

* Messages can be kept in the queue from **1 minute up to 14 days**.

### 🔸 Message Size

* Maximum message size: **256 KB**.
* Larger messages can be stored in S3 with pointers stored in SQS.

### 🔸 Batching

* Send/receive/delete messages in batches (up to 10 per call) to save costs.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

* Decouple microservices
* Async processing (e.g., video encoding, email sending)
* Buffer spikes in traffic
* Workflow engines
* Background jobs and queue-based load leveling

---

## 🔐 Security

* IAM policies control access to queues.
* Data is encrypted:

  * **In-transit** via HTTPS
  * **At rest** using **SSE-SQS**, **SSE-KMS**, or **SSE-C**

## 📈 Benefits

| Feature             | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Fully Managed**   | No server to manage or scale manually          |
| **Highly Scalable** | Handles millions of messages per second        |
| **Durable**         | Stores messages across multiple AZs            |
| **Decoupling**      | Services don't need to be aware of each other  |
| **Cost-Effective**  | Pay-per-request pricing, supports long polling |

---

## 🔚 Final Summary

> **Amazon SQS** is a powerful tool to build **reliable, scalable, and decoupled systems**. It buffers messages between components, improves fault tolerance, and supports high-throughput workloads — all without requiring infrastructure management.

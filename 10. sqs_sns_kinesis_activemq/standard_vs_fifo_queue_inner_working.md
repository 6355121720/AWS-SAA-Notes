Absolutely. Here's the **deep-dive, real internal flow** of both **Standard Queue** and **FIFO Queue** in Amazon SQS — focusing on what **actually happens inside**, step-by-step, to explain **why Standard can have duplicates** and **FIFO prevents them**.

---

## 🟢 STANDARD QUEUE — In-Depth Internal Flow

### 🧠 Goal: High availability, scalability, and performance — not strict order or exactly-once

---

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Internal Flow

#### 1. **Message Send**

* When you send a message to a Standard queue:

  * SQS **replicates it to multiple storage nodes** in different Availability Zones.
  * These nodes are called **message brokers**, and they are **sharded** for scalability.
  * No strict position/order is assigned at write time — SQS just ensures the message is safely stored across its backend.

> ✅ High durability — if one AZ goes down, your message still exists in others.

---

#### 2. **Message Storage**

* Stored messages are **spread across multiple SQS partitions (internal shards)**.
* Each partition handles a subset of messages, and they are **not strictly coordinated for order**.
* Messages are assigned a **message ID**, but **no ordering metadata** is stored.

> ⚠️ This lack of ordering enforcement allows **out-of-order delivery** in read time.

---

#### 3. **Message Receive (Visibility Timeout Starts)**

* A consumer sends a `ReceiveMessage` call.
* SQS picks a message from one of its shards and returns it.
* That message is marked **invisible for the visibility timeout** (default: 30 sec).
* The consumer now processes the message.

> 🧠 No global lock or tracking — SQS doesn’t "track" the message beyond hiding it for timeout.

---

#### 4. **Potential for Duplicates**

* If the consumer:

  * Crashes
  * Doesn't respond
  * Or fails to call `DeleteMessage` in time

  Then the message **reappears** for delivery.

* Also: Due to **replication lag**, **network retries**, or **parallel consumer fetches**, SQS may return the **same message from different replicas**, even if already received.

> 🧠 SQS follows **eventual consistency**, not strong consistency — so duplication is accepted as part of the model.

---

#### 5. **Deletion**

* Only when the consumer calls `DeleteMessage` with the correct **receipt handle**, the message is **fully removed** from storage.
* Until then, the message can **reappear** and be processed by others.

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Replication                   | Stored across multiple AZs                               |
| Partitioning                  | Internally sharded, no global order tracking             |
| Visibility Timeout            | Makes the message temporarily invisible to others        |
| No Deduplication Tracking     | Doesn’t track if message was already sent                |
| Deletion Required for Removal | Until explicitly deleted, message can be delivered again |

---

### 🔥 Result: **High throughput**, **low latency**, **at-least-once delivery**, **no ordering guarantee**, **possible duplicates**.

---

## 🟠 FIFO QUEUE — In-Depth Internal Flow

### 🧠 Goal: Preserve **strict order**, ensure **exactly-once processing** (within a 5-minute deduplication window)

---

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Internal Flow

#### 1. **Message Send**

* When you send a message to a FIFO queue:

  * You must provide:

    * **Message Group ID** (mandatory)
    * **Message Deduplication ID** (optional – default is content-based hash)
  * SQS stores:

    * The message
    * The message group ID
    * The deduplication ID (in memory and backend)
  * It places the message in an **ordered internal queue per Message Group ID**.

> ✅ Each message group behaves like a **strict FIFO stream**, handled independently.

---

#### 2. **Deduplication Logic**

* When sending a message:

  * If the deduplication ID (or body hash) **matches a recently received message** (within 5 minutes), SQS drops it silently.
  * This prevents **accidental duplicates from client retries**.

---

#### 3. **Message Storage**

* Internally, FIFO queue maintains a **sequenced buffer per group ID**.
* It stores messages **in order**, based on arrival.
* Each message group is processed **sequentially** — like a single-threaded queue.

---

#### 4. **Message Receive (Visibility Timeout Starts)**

* A consumer requests messages.
* SQS returns the **next message in order from the group**, and **starts visibility timeout**.
* Other consumers **cannot read messages from that group** until:

  * That message is deleted
  * Or timeout expires (it can cause duplicate processing, go to the end and read how to prevent this.)

> 🔒 This **group-level locking** guarantees that only one message from a group is being processed at any time.

---

#### 5. **Processing Guarantee**

* If the message is processed and `DeleteMessage` is called:

  * The message is **deleted permanently**.
  * The **next message in the group is unlocked** for delivery.

* If not deleted:

  * Message becomes visible again after visibility timeout.

> 🔁 Exactly-once is ensured through **deduplication ID** + **sequential group locking**.

| Sequenced Buffer      | Maintains strict order inside message group        |
| Group Locking         | Only one in-flight message per group               |

### 🔒 Result: **Strict ordering**, **exactly-once processing**, **no duplicates**, **slightly lower throughput** due to sequencing constraints.

✅ **Yes**, in FIFO queues, if a consumer takes longer than the **visibility timeout**, the message becomes **visible again**, and **another consumer can pick and process it**, leading to **duplicate processing**.

❗**SQS only ensures one successful deletion**, not one-time processing.

---

### 🔐 To avoid this:

1. **Set visibility timeout** > max processing time
2. Use `**ChangeMessageVisibility**` if processing takes longer
3. Ensure **idempotent logic** in your app (avoid double side effects)
4. Track processed messages (e.g., in Redis or DB)

---

🧠 **FIFO deduplication only works at message send**, not at consumer level.

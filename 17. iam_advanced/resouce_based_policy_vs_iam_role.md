Here’s a **clean, structured, in-depth breakdown** of the **differences between IAM Roles and Resource-based Policies**, including how **cross-account access** and **EventBridge behavior** works — all in **my format**:

## ✅ IAM Roles vs Resource-Based Policies (RBP)

| Feature                     | **IAM Roles**                                                                                   | **Resource-Based Policies**                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👤 **Who Uses It**          | A **principal assumes a role** to act with the role's permissions                               | The **resource itself defines who can access it** (via RBP)         |
| 🔄 **Permission Handling**  | The principal **temporarily drops** their own permissions and **adopts the role's permissions** | The principal **keeps their original permissions**                  |
| 🔒 **Used For**             | Controlled **temporary access**                                                                 | Allowing access **directly on the resource**                        |
| 🌍 **Cross-Account Access** | Principal must assume a role **in the target account**                                          | Principal accesses the resource **directly via its policy**         |
| 📋 **Defined On**           | Defined in the **trusted account** (IAM Role)                                                   | Attached to the **resource** (e.g. S3 Bucket Policy, Lambda Policy) |
| 🔄 **Switching Required?**  | ✅ Yes, requires `sts:AssumeRole`                                                                | ❌ No switching needed                                               |

## 🧪 Example Scenario: Cross-Account S3 Access

### 🎯 Goal:

User in **Account A** wants to upload files to an **S3 bucket in Account B**.

### ✅ **Option 1: IAM Role**

* User in A assumes a role in B.
* Role in B has permission to upload to the S3 bucket.
* After assumption, the user **cannot use their original permissions** (e.g., scan DynamoDB in A).

```json
// Trust policy in Account B
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/Alice" },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}
```

```json
// Role permissions in Account B
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::account-b-bucket/*"
}
```

### ✅ **Option 2: Resource-Based Policy**

* S3 bucket in B has a **bucket policy** that allows the user (or role) in A to write objects.
* User can still scan DynamoDB in A **and** upload to S3 in B — **no context switch**.

```json
// S3 bucket policy in Account B
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/Alice" },
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::account-b-bucket/*"
}
```

> 🧠 **Use resource-based policies when:**
>
> * You want **simpler cross-account access**.
> * The service/resource **supports resource-based policies**.
> * You want to **retain existing permissions** during the call.

## ⚙️ EventBridge: How Permissions Are Handled on Targets

| Target Type             | RBP Supported?   | What EventBridge Uses?   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Lambda                  | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Resource-Based Policy  |
| SNS Topic               | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Resource-Based Policy  |
| SQS Queue               | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Resource-Based Policy  |
| S3 Bucket               | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Resource-Based Policy  |
| **Kinesis Data Stream** | ✅ Yes but ❌ Used | ❌ IAM Role (only method) |
| ECS Task                | ❌ No             | ❌ IAM Role               |
| EC2 Auto Scaling        | ❌ No             | ❌ IAM Role               |

> 🔎 **Important Exception**:
> Even though **Kinesis** supports RBPs, **EventBridge still uses IAM roles** for Kinesis targets.

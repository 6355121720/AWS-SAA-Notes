Here's your full **in-depth explanation of IAM Permission Boundaries and Policy Evaluation Logic** rewritten in my structured, detailed, and exam-oriented format:

### 🧠 IAM Permission Boundaries — In-Depth Notes

---

### ✅ What is a Permission Boundary?

An **IAM permission boundary** is an advanced feature that **limits the maximum permissions** a user or role can ever get, **no matter what permissions their identity-based policy grants**.

* 🔒 It **restricts permissions**, not grants them.
* 📛 It is **only applicable to IAM users and IAM roles** — **not IAM groups**.
* 📋 Its syntax is exactly like a regular IAM policy (JSON), but it behaves differently.
* 🧪 Think of it as a **guardrail** — it defines how far a user/role’s actual permissions can go, even if the IAM policy says "Allow everything".

---

### ⚙️ How Permission Boundaries Work

Let's break it down with an example.

#### Case Study: John the Developer

* 👤 John has:

  * ✅ IAM policy attached: `AdministratorAccess` (full power)
  * 🔒 Permission boundary: `AmazonS3FullAccess`

🔍 Evaluation:

* You might think John can do anything, but **NO** — **his permissions are limited by the boundary**.
* The `AdministratorAccess` policy says he can use EC2, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.
* But the permission boundary only permits actions on **S3**.

✅ **Effective permissions = intersection of IAM policy and boundary.**

So John can **only** use **S3 actions**.

---

### 🎯 Another Example: No Effective Permission

* John has:

  * ✅ IAM policy: `iam:CreateUser`
  * 🔒 Permission boundary: Only allows `ec2:*`, `s3:*`

🔍 Evaluation:

* The policy grants `iam:CreateUser`.
* The boundary **does NOT include IAM actions**.
* 🚫 Result: John **cannot** create users. Why? Because `iam:CreateUser` falls **outside the boundary**.

### 🧠 Key Use Cases for Permission Boundaries

| Use Case                        | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Delegate IAM                 | Let developers create IAM roles for Lambda functions — but only within a tightly controlled boundary. |
| 🚫 Prevent Privilege Escalation | Ensure no one can make themselves admin, even if they manage their own permissions.                   |
| 🧍 Restrict Specific User       | Apply tight control to a single user without affecting the whole org via SCPs.                        |

### 🏛️ Combining SCP + Permission Boundary + Identity Policy

Let's look at the **full permission evaluation path**.

---

### 🧩 IAM Policy Evaluation Logic (Flowchart Summary)

Here’s how AWS evaluates whether an IAM user/role can perform an action:

```
START
  ↓
❗ Check for explicit deny (anywhere)
  → YES → 🚫 DENY
  → NO  → continue
  ↓
🏛️ Service Control Policies (SCPs)
  → Is action allowed by SCP?
    → NO → 🚫 DENY (implicit deny)
    → YES → continue
  ↓
📦 Resource-based policies (e.g., S3 bucket policy)
  → Is action allowed?
    → NO → 🚫 DENY (implicit)
    → YES → continue
  ↓
👤 Identity-based policies (attached to user/role)
  → Is action allowed?
    → NO → 🚫 DENY (implicit)
    → YES → continue
  ↓
📏 IAM Permission Boundaries
  → Is action within boundary?
    → NO → 🚫 DENY
    → YES → continue
  ↓
🧾 Session Policies (from STS or AssumeRole)
  → Is action allowed?
    → NO → 🚫 DENY
    → YES → ✅ ALLOW
```

---

### 💣 Important Rule: Explicit Deny Wins Always

Even if multiple policies allow an action, if **any policy** (SCP, identity, boundary, resource-based) **explicitly denies** it — the result is always:

> ❌ **Access Denied**

---

### 🧪 Evaluation Example

#### Policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "sqs:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sqs:DeleteQueue",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Questions:

1. **Can you perform `sqs:CreateQueue`?**

   * ❌ **NO** — Explicit deny on `sqs:*`

2. **Can you perform `sqs:DeleteQueue`?**

   * ❌ **NO** — Even though allowed explicitly, `sqs:DeleteQueue` is included in `sqs:*` deny, so **denied**.

3. **Can you perform `ec2:DescribeInstances`?**

   * ❌ **NO** — Not mentioned in any allow. Implicit deny applies.

### 🔐 Summary — IAM Permission Boundaries vs. SCPs

| Feature    | Permission Boundary              | SCP                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Applies To | IAM Users & Roles                | All accounts/entities under Org |
| Effect     | Limits max permissions           | Whitelists or blocks services   |
| Admin Use  | Fine-grained internal delegation | Org-wide security control       |
| Syntax     | IAM Policy JSON                  | Similar to IAM policy           |
| Can Deny?  | No, only allow boundary          | Yes, allow and deny both        |

---

### ✅ Final Tip

**To get permission, the action must pass ALL layers:**

✅ Allowed by SCP
✅ Allowed by identity-based policy
✅ Within permission boundary
✅ Allowed by resource-based policy
✅ Allowed by session policy
🚫 And not explicitly denied anywhere

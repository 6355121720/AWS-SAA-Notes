# ‚úÖ **AWS Organizations ‚Äì Full In-Depth Notes (with SCPs & OUs)**

---

## üåç What is AWS Organizations?

**AWS Organizations** is a **global AWS service** that lets you **centrally manage and govern** multiple AWS accounts within one umbrella.

* **Primary account** = **Management Account**
* **Other accounts** = **Member Accounts**
* An account can **only belong to one organization**

---

## üß± Key Features

### 1. üîê **Centralized Account Management**

* Manage **multiple AWS accounts** from one place
* Apply **organization-wide policies**, like **SCPs**
* Organize accounts using **OUs (Organizational Units)**

---

### 2. üí≥ **Consolidated Billing**

* All charges go to the **management account**
* Get **volume-based discounts** across accounts:

  * E.g., EC2, S3 tiered pricing
* **Reserved Instances and Savings Plans** can be **shared** across accounts

üîÑ Example:
A reserved EC2 instance unused in one account can benefit another account in the org.

---

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Automated Account Creation**

* Use **AWS Organizations API** to create accounts programmatically
* Automatically place new accounts into OUs
* Simplifies setting up dev/test/prod environments

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Organizational Units (OUs)

### üìå What are OUs?

**OUs** are **logical containers** within an AWS Organization to group accounts.

You can create:

* Flat OUs (e.g., Dev, Prod)
* Nested OUs (e.g., Prod ‚Üí Finance, HR)

### üß† Purpose of OUs:

* Organize accounts by **business units**, **environments**, or **projects**
* Attach **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to govern permissions

---

### ‚úÖ Examples of OU Structures:

#### By Environment:

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev OU
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev Accounts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prod OU
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Finance OU
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HR OU
```

#### By Business Units:

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales OU
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Retail OU
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Finance OU
```

#### By Projects:

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectA OU
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectB OU
```

You can **mix and match** depending on your governance and billing needs.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Service Control Policies (SCPs)

### üîê What are SCPs?

**Service Control Policies (SCPs)** are **organization-level guardrails** that set the **maximum permissions** a member account can have.

* SCPs **do not grant permissions**
* They **restrict what IAM users, roles, and root users can do**
* Evaluated in combination with IAM policies

---

### üîç SCP Evaluation Logic:

> **Effective permissions = IAM permissions ‚à© SCP permissions ‚à© resource policies**

Even if IAM allows it, **if SCP blocks it, the action is denied**.

---

### üß† Key SCP Rules:

| Concept                                           | Explanation                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SCPs **limit**, not grant                         | IAM policies must still allow actions explicitly                              |
| SCPs apply to **member accounts only** by default | Management account is **not affected** unless **explicitly targeted**         |
| SCPs are **hierarchical and intersecting**        | Final allowed actions = **intersection** of all SCPs from root ‚Üí OU ‚Üí account |
| No SCP attached = implicitly **"FullAWSAccess"**  | SCPs are opt-in, so no SCP = full access (but still IAM-controlled)           |

---

### üìç SCP Scope & Inheritance

| SCP Attached To        | Affects                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Organization Root**  | All member accounts + OUs (‚ùå not management account)                                 |
| **An OU**              | Only member accounts in that OU (and nested OUs)                                     |
| **A specific account** | Only that account                                                                    |
| **Management account** | ‚ùå Not affected by any OU SCP <br> ‚úÖ Only affected by SCP **directly attached** to it |

‚úÖ **OUs do not ‚Äúcontain‚Äù the management account**, even though it appears under root.

---

### üß† SCP is an **INTERSECTION** ‚Äì not a union!

> If **any SCP in the hierarchy blocks an action**, it‚Äôs **denied** ‚Äî no matter what other SCPs allow.

---

### üì¶ Example SCPs

#### ‚úÖ Allow only EC2 and S3 (block everything else):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*",
        "ec2:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ‚ùå Block DynamoDB across an OU:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

üß† Even with IAM `AdministratorAccess`, access to DynamoDB will be blocked.

### üîí Management Account Behavior

| Scenario                                    | SCP Applies to Management Account?      |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| SCP attached to Root                        | ‚ùå No                                    |
| SCP attached to OU                          | ‚ùå No (management is not part of any OU) |
| SCP attached directly to management account | ‚úÖ Yes                                   |

You **must manually attach an SCP to the management account** if you want to restrict it.

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Use Cases for SCPs

| Use Case                                               | SCP Strategy                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Limit all accounts to only EC2 and S3                  | Attach "Allow EC2 & S3 only" SCP to OUs                                                 |
| Block IAM modifications by developers                  | SCP with `Deny iam:*` attached to Dev OU                                                |
| Allow only billing-related actions to billing accounts | SCP with `Allow billing:*` only                                                         |
| Prevent data exfiltration                              | SCPs that deny `s3:PutObject` to unknown destinations or `kms:Decrypt` to external keys |

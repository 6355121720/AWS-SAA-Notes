## üß± AWS Placement Groups ‚Äì In Depth, Without Confusion

**Placement Groups** control **how EC2 instances are placed on underlying hardware** in an AWS Availability Zone (AZ) to meet **specific performance, fault tolerance, or networking** needs.

---

## üéØ WHY Use Placement Groups?

You don‚Äôt always want EC2s placed randomly. You might want:

* **Low-latency, high-bandwidth** communication between instances.
* **Fault isolation** (keep instances on different hardware).
* **Partition-aware systems** (like HDFS or Cassandra) to avoid correlated failures.

## üìä Types of Placement Groups

| Type          | Purpose                                       | Max EC2s / Limits                            | Fault Tolerance                                 | Use Case Examples                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster**   | Put instances **close together** on same rack | Limited by AZ hardware capacity              | ‚ùå Low (all in same rack)                        | HPC, ML training, distributed GPU systems |
| **Spread**    | Place instances **far apart** across racks    | Max 7 per AZ (soft limit)                    | ‚úÖ High (one per rack)                           | HA-critical nodes: DB, NameNode           |
| **Partition** | Group instances into **isolated partitions**  | Up to 7 partitions per AZ (can be increased) | ‚úÖ Medium (1 partition fails, others unaffected) | Big Data: Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka        |

## üîç Detailed View of Each Type

---

### üîπ 1. **Cluster Placement Group**

* **All EC2s are in a single AZ and often same rack or within close proximity**
* **Best for**: Intra-node communication with **<10Œºs latency**, **high throughput (10‚Äì100 Gbps)** between instances
* **Warning**: If capacity not available, instance launch **will fail**
* **Ideal EC2 types**: `c5n`, `p4`, `inf2`, `g5`, HPC-optimized instances

üîß **Use Case Examples**:

* High-performance computing (HPC)
* Real-time video processing
* Distributed GPU training
* Financial risk modeling

---

### üîπ 2. **Spread Placement Group**

* **Each EC2 is on separate physical rack**, power source, and network
* **Max 7 EC2s per AZ** (can be increased via support request)
* **Best for fault isolation** ‚Äî even if hardware fails, others survive
* Instances can be **in different AZs** (cross-AZ spread group)

üîß **Use Case Examples**:

* Production DB + replica
* Multi-node quorum systems
* Critical single points like ZooKeeper, Kafka controllers, etc.

---

### üîπ 3. **Partition Placement Group**

* EC2s grouped into **logical partitions**, each with **isolated hardware** (power, rack, network)
* AWS **never places partitions on the same infrastructure**
* You can **assign EC2s to a specific partition** (e.g., `Partition 0 = DataNode`, `Partition 1 = ReplicaNode`)
* Can be spread across multiple AZs
* Best for **fault-tolerant distributed systems**

üîß **Use Case Examples**:

* Hadoop/HDFS
* Cassandra
* Kafka brokers with rack awareness
* ElasticSearch clusters

## üß† Important Concepts

| Concept                   | Notes                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AZ Limitation**         | Placement group is **per AZ**; EC2s must be launched in same AZ unless using **Spread (cross-AZ)** |
| **Launch Failures**       | In **Cluster**, if there isn't enough capacity = launch fails                                      |
| **Partition Awareness**   | You control which EC2 goes in which partition (optional)                                           |
| **Elastic Load Balancer** | Can front EC2s in placement groups, especially for **Cluster** setups                              |
| **Spot Instances**        | Can be used, but **Cluster groups** might fail launch due to capacity constraints                  |

## üìå Best Practices

‚úÖ Use **Cluster** only when you need low latency + high throughput
‚úÖ Use **Spread** for **max isolation** between critical EC2s
‚úÖ Use **Partition** for **distributed storage** and **node-awareness**

üîÅ **You cannot move existing EC2s into a placement group**. You must launch them **within** the group.

üö´ You can‚Äôt **combine all types** in one group.

# ✅ AWS SSM Session Manager — Deep Dive Notes

---

## 🚀 What is Session Manager?

**SSM Session Manager** lets you connect to EC2 instances **without using SSH**, **without a key pair**, and **without opening port 22**. It’s a fully managed, secure alternative to SSH or bastion hosts.

---

## 💡 Why Use It?

| Feature                  | Benefit                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 No SSH keys           | No need to manage or rotate SSH keys                 |
| 🚫 No port 22            | Improves security posture (no open inbound ports)    |
| 🧰 Works with IAM        | Access control and logging via IAM policies          |
| 📋 Logs to S3/CloudWatch | Full auditability of who did what inside the session |

---

## 🧱 How It Works

1. **SSM Agent** runs on the EC2 instance.
2. EC2 must have an **IAM Role** with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy.
3. The agent establishes an **outbound** HTTPS connection to SSM.
4. You use **Session Manager** in the AWS Console or CLI to connect.

🧠 Note: No inbound traffic needed → your **SG can block all inbound** rules.

---

## 🖥️ Launching an EC2 for Session Manager Access

✅ Follow this minimal, secure setup:

1. **Use AMI**: Amazon Linux 2 (has SSM Agent preinstalled)
2. **Instance Type**: `t2.micro` (Free Tier)
3. **No Key Pair** (we won’t SSH)
4. **Security Group**: No inbound rules at all
5. **Attach IAM Role** with this policy:

   * `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`

---

## 🔍 Verifying It Works

Check in:
→ **Systems Manager → Fleet Manager → Managed Instances**

✅ Instance must appear here as:

* Status: **Online**
* SSM Agent: **Running**

---

## 📡 Starting a Session

1. Go to: `Systems Manager → Session Manager`
2. Click **Start Session**
3. Choose your EC2 → get a secure shell (like SSH) inside browser!

🎯 Test commands:

```bash
ping google.com
hostname
ifconfig
```

Your private IP and system info confirm you're **inside the EC2**, securely.

## 🛠️ EC2 Access Methods Compared

| Method               | Port 22? | SSH Key?        | IAM-based? | Secure?   | Recommended? |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| SSH                  | ✅ Open   | ✅ Required      | ❌          | ❌ Exposed | ❌ No         |
| EC2 Instance Connect | ✅ Open   | ❌ Temporary key | ✅ Partial  | ⚠️ Medium | ❌ No         |
| **Session Manager**  | ❌ Closed | ❌ None          | ✅ Full IAM | ✅ High    | ✅ Yes        |

---

## 📁 Logging Sessions

✅ You can configure **session logs to go to**:

* **Amazon S3** (for long-term archiving)
* **CloudWatch Logs** (for real-time auditing)

🧠 Use this to comply with security, governance, or forensic analysis.

---

## 🧽 Cleanup Reminder

> After demo or practice, always **terminate the EC2** instance to avoid billing.

---

## ✅ Summary — Key Takeaways

* **Session Manager = SSH-free shell** into EC2 via browser or CLI
* Requires **SSM Agent + IAM Role with SSM permissions**
* No open inbound ports needed → **high security**
* Logs sessions for audit via S3 or CloudWatch
* Works for **Linux, Windows, and macOS EC2s**

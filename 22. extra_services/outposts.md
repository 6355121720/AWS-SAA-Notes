# 🏠 AWS Outposts – Hybrid Cloud with AWS Inside

## 🌐 What Is Hybrid Cloud?

A **Hybrid Cloud** setup combines:

* ☁️ Public cloud (e.g., AWS)
* 🏢 On-premises infrastructure (e.g., corporate data center)

**Problem**:

* Different environments → **different tools, APIs, and skills**
* Complexity increases for operations and management

---

## 🧱 What Is AWS Outposts?

> **AWS Outposts** is a **fully managed service** that brings **AWS infrastructure and services** *physically* into your on-premises data center.

* ✅ Delivered as **pre-configured server racks**
* ✅ Installed and maintained **by AWS**
* ✅ You get **the same AWS APIs, services, and tools** – but running *locally*

---

## 🧰 How It Works

* 🛠️ AWS delivers and installs Outpost racks **in your on-premises location**
* 🖥️ You can use the **AWS Console, CLI, and SDKs** to manage resources on Outposts
* 🔐 You (the customer) are responsible for **physical security** of the hardware

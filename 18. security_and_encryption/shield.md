Here’s the **in-depth, deeply structured version** of your AWS **Shield – DDoS Protection** notes, following the same refined format as previous modules:

---

# 🛡️ AWS Shield – DDoS Protection (Layer 3/4/7)

## 🔍 What is AWS Shield?

AWS Shield is a **managed DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection service** that safeguards your AWS infrastructure from volumetric and sophisticated attacks. Its purpose is to keep your web applications and services **available and responsive**, even under large-scale attack scenarios.

---

## 🆓 AWS Shield Standard – Always-On, Free Protection

### ✅ Automatically enabled for **all AWS accounts**

No setup, no extra cost — provides **baseline DDoS protection**.

### 🛠️ Protects against common **Layer 3 & Layer 4** attacks:

| Attack Type        | Description                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYN floods         | Overloads with TCP connection requests                                   |
| UDP floods         | Floods with stateless traffic                                            |
| Reflection attacks | Uses spoofed requests to elicit large responses from third-party servers |
| Other Volumetric   | Generic L3/L4 bandwidth/packet rate floods                               |

### 📦 Protection Scope:

* ✅ Amazon EC2 (Elastic IPs)
* ✅ Elastic Load Balancer (ALB & NLB)
* ✅ Amazon CloudFront (edge locations)
* ✅ AWS Global Accelerator
* ✅ Route 53 (DNS service)

## 💎 AWS Shield Advanced – Paid, Enterprise-Grade Protection

### 💰 Pricing:

* \~\$3,000/month per **organization** (not per account/resource)

### 🔐 Features:

| 👨‍✈️ **24x7 AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT)** | On-call experts to help mitigate active threats (human-assisted mitigation)                      |
| 🔄 **WAF Integration**                      | Can auto-deploy AWS WAF rules during attacks (e.g., rate-limiting abusive IPs)                   |
| 💵 **Financial Protection**                 | Refunds **scaling and data transfer costs** incurred due to attack traffic during covered events |
| 🧠 **Adaptive Protection**                  | Learns normal patterns over time and adjusts thresholds dynamically                              |
| 📈 **Real-time Metrics & Alerts**           | Integrated with CloudWatch and AWS Firewall Manager for monitoring and alerting                  |

---

## 📦 Automatic Application Layer Protection (Layer 7)

With Shield Advanced + WAF, AWS can **automatically create and apply WAF rules** to protect against:

* HTTP flood attacks
* Malicious user agents
* Bots/spiders
* Repeated bad behavior from specific IPs / patterns

Here’s a crystal-clear, structured rewrite of your notes on **S3 Replication with Encryption**, designed for strong exam recall and practical use:

# 🪣🔁 S3 Replication + Encryption – Deep Dive

---

## 📦 What is S3 Replication?

**Amazon S3 Replication** automatically copies objects from one bucket (source) to another (destination), either:

* **Same Region** → Same-Region Replication (SRR)
* **Cross-Region** → Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

---

## 🔐 How Does Encryption Affect Replication?

### 🔓 1. **Unencrypted Objects**

✅ Replicated by default — no special config needed.

---

### 🟡 2. **SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys)**

✅ Fully supported by default.
AWS handles encryption/decryption automatically during replication.

---

### 🟠 3. **SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys)**

✅ Supported — but **you must re-provide** the key during replication.
Rarely used due to security risk (you manage the key material manually).

---

### 🔴 4. **SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS Keys)**

⛔ **NOT replicated by default**
To replicate SSE-KMS encrypted objects, you must **explicitly enable**:

#### ✅ Required Steps:

1. **Enable replication of SSE-KMS objects** during rule setup.
2. **Specify the KMS key** to use for **encrypting data in the target bucket**.
3. **Update target KMS key policy** to allow access to the **S3 replication role**.
4. **Create/assign an IAM Role** that:

   * 🔓 Can decrypt source objects
   * 🔐 Can encrypt target objects with the destination KMS key

> This process introduces additional **KMS API calls** — both `Decrypt` and `Encrypt`.

---

## ⚠️ KMS Throttling Risk

* Each replicated SSE-KMS object involves two KMS operations:

  * 1 × **Decrypt** (source)
  * 1 × **Encrypt** (destination)
* High-volume replication can hit the **default KMS request quota**
* 💡 **Solution:** Request a **KMS quota increase**

---

## 🤔 Should You Use Multi-Region KMS Keys?

You *can* use Multi-Region Keys (MRKs), but beware:

| 🔍 Key Fact                                     | Explanation                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **No advantage with S3**                      | S3 **treats MRKs as distinct keys** — even across Regions |
| 🔁 Objects are still decrypted and re-encrypted | Even if the same MRK is used                              |
| ✅ Behavior same as using 2 regional KMS keys    | So no latency or replication benefit here                 |

> ⚠️ MRKs **don’t eliminate re-encryption overhead** in S3 replication!

## ✅ Final Cheat Sheet

| Encryption Type | Replicated by Default? | Notes                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Unencrypted** | ✅ Yes                  | No special setup                                |
| **SSE-S3**      | ✅ Yes                  | Fully managed by AWS                            |
| **SSE-C**       | ✅ Yes (manual setup)   | Client must supply keys again                   |
| **SSE-KMS**     | ❌ No (must enable)     | Requires IAM role + KMS key config              |
| **MRKs**        | ✅ But no optimization  | Treated as separate keys; still decrypt/encrypt |

## 🛡️ Key Roles & Policies Involved

* 🔐 **KMS Key Policy (target region):**
  Must allow `kms:Encrypt` to the **S3 replication IAM role**

* 📜 **IAM Role (replication):**
  Must have:

  * `kms:Decrypt` on **source KMS key**
  * `kms:Encrypt` on **destination KMS key**

# 🌐 AWS KMS – Multi-Region Keys (MRKs)

---

## 🔑 What Are KMS Multi-Region Keys?

**Multi-Region Keys (MRKs)** are **KMS keys that replicate across AWS Regions** with the **same key ID and key material**.

| Concept          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Replication   | One **primary key** in a Region (e.g., `us-east-1`) is **replicated** to other Regions |
| 📛 Same Key ID   | All replicas share the **same key ID and key ARN** suffix, e.g., `mrk-`                |
| 🔒 Same Material | The **key material is identical** across Regions (enables cross-region crypto)         |

> Encrypt in one Region, decrypt in another — **no re-encryption required**.

## 📦 Use Cases

### ✅ Client-Side Encryption – Global Scope

| Use Case                    | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global DynamoDB Tables**  | Encrypt attributes in one Region; decrypt in another using MRKs |
| **Global Aurora Databases** | Encrypt sensitive columns client-side before insert             |
| **Global Applications**     | Use AWS Encryption SDK to secure sensitive data across Regions  |

## 🧠 Real-World Example – DynamoDB Global Tables

| Step | Action                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | App in `us-east-1` encrypts SSN using **primary MRK**                            |
| 2️⃣  | Encrypted SSN written to **DynamoDB Global Table**                               |
| 3️⃣  | Table replicates to `ap-southeast-2`                                             |
| 4️⃣  | App in `ap-southeast-2` decrypts SSN using **replica MRK** locally (low latency) |

> 🔐 Data is encrypted **client-side**, protecting it even from DB admins.

## 🧠 Real-World Example – Global Aurora

| Step | Action                                                           |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | App encrypts a column (e.g., SSN) using AWS Encryption SDK + MRK |
| 2️⃣  | Encrypted data inserted into **Aurora Global DB**                |
| 3️⃣  | Data replicates globally                                         |
| 4️⃣  | App in replica Region decrypts using **local replica MRK**       |

✅ Fast
✅ Secure
✅ Region-local KMS access → low latency

## 🚧 Important Considerations

| Topic                    | Details                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Not Global Keys**    | Each Region has a **separate key instance** (same material, but individually managed) |
| 🔐 **Separate Policies** | Each replica has its **own key policy** — must be configured individually             |
| 🔁 **Rotation Support**  | If enabled on **primary**, rotation automatically propagates to replicas              |
| 🚫 **Not Default**       | AWS does **not** recommend using MRKs unless **explicitly needed** (adds complexity)  |

## ✅ Summary – Key Takeaways

| Key Point                 | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Same Key ID + Material | Enables seamless cross-region encryption/decryption            |
| 📍 Managed Independently  | Each Region has **independent key policy and lifecycle**       |
| ⚡ Local Decryption        | Reduces latency by **using local KMS endpoint**                |
| 🔐 Client-Side Security   | Encrypts individual fields before storing (DynamoDB / Aurora)  |
| 🔒 Protects From Admins   | Even database admins **can’t decrypt** without KMS permissions |

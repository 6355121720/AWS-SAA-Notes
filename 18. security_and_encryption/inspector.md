## 🛡️ Amazon Inspector — *Automated Vulnerability Management for AWS Resources*

### 🔍 What is Amazon Inspector?

Amazon Inspector is a **fully managed, automated vulnerability scanning service**. It continuously scans key AWS resources like EC2, Lambda, and container images (in ECR) to detect software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure — helping you meet security best practices without manual effort.

No manual scans. No static checks. Continuous, real-time security intelligence.

### 🧠 How It Works (Under the Hood)

| **Resource**       | **How It Is Scanned**                                                                      | **What’s Evaluated**                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 Instances**  | Uses **SSM Agent** (Systems Manager) to continuously inspect OS and network accessibility. | Open ports, insecure packages, exposed services, known CVEs.                  |
| **ECR Containers** | Automatically scanned **on every push** to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).        | Image layers scanned for vulnerable dependencies (CVEs).                      |
| **Lambda**         | Scanned **at deployment time** (each publish version or update triggers a scan).           | Code and dependencies (e.g., Python modules, Node packages) checked for CVEs. |

### 📚 Backed by CVE Intelligence

* Amazon Inspector uses the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** database.
* CVEs are updated **continuously**, and Inspector **re-evaluates resources** when new vulnerabilities are published.
* Each vulnerability is scored using **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) and **CVSS** to give a **risk score** — helping you **prioritize remediation**.

---

### 🔗 Integration and Reporting

1. **Findings go to:**

   * 🧭 **AWS Security Hub** – central visibility across AWS security tools.
   * 🌩 **Amazon EventBridge** – for automation (e.g., send notification, invoke Lambda).
2. **Automated Response Example:**

   * Vulnerability found → EventBridge rule triggers Lambda → Open Jira ticket or isolate EC2.

---

### 🔐 Key Capabilities

✅ **Continuous scanning** – not just on schedule or demand
✅ **No agents for Lambda & ECR** — fully native
✅ **Risk-based prioritization** using CVSS/EPSS
✅ **No manual setup** — auto-discovers supported resources
✅ **Tight integration** with Security Hub and EventBridge

### 📍 Summary – Inspector vs Other AWS Security Services

| **Service**          | **Focus**                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon Inspector** | Vulnerability scanning of EC2, Lambda, ECR    |
| **GuardDuty**        | Threat detection (malicious behavior, misuse) |
| **Security Hub**     | Centralized view of all findings              |
| **AWS Config**       | Compliance + drift detection                  |
| **Macie**            | Sensitive data discovery (e.g., PII in S3)    |

---

### 🧾 Final Notes

* 🛠️ EC2 requires **SSM Agent installed and managed** (via Systems Manager).
* 🔄 **Re-scans happen automatically** when:

  * New CVEs are released
  * New versions of packages are found
  * Code/images/functions are updated
* 🚫 Inspector **does not support on-prem systems or third-party registries** (only ECR).

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* Amazon Inspector is your **automated vulnerability scanner** for AWS-native compute resources.
* It ensures **real-time security** for EC2, Lambda, and container images in ECR.
* With **zero friction**, **no agents (except EC2)**, and **real-time findings**, it’s built for modern DevSecOps.
* All findings can trigger **automated actions** via EventBridge or be **centralized in Security Hub** for visibility.

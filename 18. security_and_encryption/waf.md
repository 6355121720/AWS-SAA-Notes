Here‚Äôs a clear and structured deep-dive on **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** in my style, enriched with clarity, architecture flow, and real-world technical insight:

## üõ°Ô∏è AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) ‚Äî In-Depth

### üìå What is AWS WAF?

AWS WAF is a **Layer 7 firewall** that protects your **web applications** from common HTTP-based attacks like SQL injection, XSS, bot traffic, etc.
It doesn't work at network level (Layer 4, like TCP/UDP); instead, it filters **HTTP(S) requests**.

---

### üöÄ Where Can You Deploy AWS WAF?

AWS WAF integrates **only with specific Layer 7 AWS services**:

| Service                               | Supports WAF? | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Yes           | Must be in the **same region** as the Web ACL |
| ‚úÖ **Amazon API Gateway**              | Yes           | Regional or Edge optimized                    |
| ‚úÖ **AWS CloudFront (CDN)**            | Yes           | **Global scope** Web ACL needed               |
| ‚úÖ **AppSync (GraphQL API)**           | Yes           | Regional WAF                                  |
| ‚úÖ **Amazon Cognito user pools**       | Yes           | Regional WAF                                  |
| ‚ùå **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**     | No            | NLB is Layer 4; not compatible with WAF       |

### üìò What is a Web ACL?

* A **Web Access Control List (Web ACL)** is a **set of rules** that defines what **HTTP(S) traffic is allowed or blocked**.
* You attach a Web ACL to a supported service (e.g., ALB or CloudFront).
* Think of it like a firewall configuration script, but for HTTP traffic.

---

### üì¶ Components of a Web ACL

1. **Rules / Rule Groups**

   * Match conditions like:

     * üìå IP Set (block/allow by IP)
     * üìå Header, URI, Query String inspection
     * üìå SQL Injection / XSS detection
     * üìå Size constraints (e.g., block if body > 2MB)
     * üìå Geo match (country-based allow/deny)
     * üìå **Rate-based rules** (block IPs if >1000 req/min)

2. **Managed Rule Groups**

   * AWS provides pre-built rules for OWASP top 10 threats.
   * Third-party managed rules also available via AWS Marketplace.

3. **Rule Priority**

   * Rules are evaluated in order.
   * First match wins: Allow, Block, or Count.

### üåç Regional vs Global Web ACLs

| Deployment Target                  | Web ACL Scope |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ALB, API Gateway, Cognito, AppSync | **Regional**  |
| CloudFront                         | **Global**    |

‚û°Ô∏è This means:

* You **must create Web ACLs in the same region** as your ALB or API Gateway.
* But for **CloudFront**, WAF is **global**, so one Web ACL can protect worldwide edge locations.

---

### üß© Reusability Concern: ‚ÄúCan I reuse Web ACL in multiple regions?‚Äù

No. **Web ACLs are region-bound**, just like IAM roles and Lambda functions.

If you want to protect two ALBs in different regions:

* You must **create a separate Web ACL in each region**, even if rules are same.
* You can simplify by using **Rule Groups**, which are reusable.

---

### üß† Real-World Use Case: WAF + ALB + Fixed IP

Problem:
You want:

* **WAF protection**
* Hosted behind **Application Load Balancer**
* But ALB doesn‚Äôt support **static IPs**

Solution:

* Use **AWS Global Accelerator** (provides static IPs)
* Front it to **ALB with WAF enabled**
* You now get both: static IPs + WAF filtering

‚úÖ **Architecture:**

```
[Client]
   |
   ‚Üì
[Global Accelerator (Static IP)]
   |
   ‚Üì
[Application Load Balancer (with WAF)]
   |
   ‚Üì
[EC2 / App Backend]
```

### üîê Summary: Key Takeaways

| Feature                    | Detail                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Protection Layer           | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)                                  |
| Use Cases                  | Protect against SQLi, XSS, bots, geo IPs, rate limits |
| Supported Services         | ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront, AppSync, Cognito        |
| Not Supported On           | Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)                       |
| Web ACL Scope              | Regional (except CloudFront - Global)                 |
| Rule Types                 | IP Set, Geo Match, Size, Regex, SQLi, XSS, Rate limit |
| Static IP with ALB + WAF   | Use Global Accelerator                                |
| Reusability Across Regions | ‚ùå Web ACLs are regional (create one per region)       |

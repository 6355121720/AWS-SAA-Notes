# üîê AWS KMS (Key Management Service) ‚Äì In-Depth Summary

---

## üöÄ What is AWS KMS?

**AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** is a **fully managed encryption key service** that lets you:

* üîê Create and manage **cryptographic keys**
* üîÑ Control key usage across **hundreds of AWS services**
* üìú Audit all usage through **CloudTrail**

> Anytime AWS encrypts something‚Äîchances are KMS is involved.

---

## üîó How It Works with AWS Services

KMS is **natively integrated** with nearly every AWS service:

| Service    | How KMS is Used                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **S3**     | Encrypt objects using SSE-KMS         |
| **EBS**    | Encrypt volumes or snapshots          |
| **RDS**    | Encrypt DB instances and backups      |
| **SSM**    | Encrypt parameters and secure strings |
| **Lambda** | Encrypt environment variables         |

Additionally, you can call KMS directly via:

* AWS CLI
* SDKs
* KMS API

This allows you to encrypt any data (e.g., passwords, tokens) manually using your keys.

## üîë Types of KMS Keys

### 1. **Symmetric Keys (Most Common)**

* üîÅ Same key used for encryption & decryption
* AWS **never exposes key material**
* All AWS service integrations use symmetric keys
* Calls like `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `GenerateDataKey`

### 2. **Asymmetric Keys**

* üîê Public key (downloadable): encrypt or verify
* üîí Private key (never leaves KMS): decrypt or sign
* Use cases: signing documents, external encryption (outside AWS)

## üß± Categories of KMS Keys

| Type                 | Who Controls It | Visible to User? | Cost         | Used For                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS-Owned Keys**   | AWS             | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Free       | Default internal encryption (e.g., SSE-S3)                  |
| **AWS-Managed Keys** | AWS             | ‚úÖ Yes (`aws/*`)  | ‚úÖ Free       | Service-specific encryption (e.g., `aws/rds`, `aws/ebs`)    |
| **Customer-Managed** | You             | ‚úÖ Full control   | üí≤ \$1/month | Custom encryption needs, cross-account, fine-grained access |

* üì• You can **import your own key material** for CMKs
* üìà Additional charges apply: **\$0.03 per 10,000 KMS API calls**

## üîÅ Key Rotation

| Key Type              | Rotation Supported | How                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| AWS-Managed Keys      | ‚úÖ Auto (1 year)    | AWS handles                           |
| Customer-Managed Keys | ‚úÖ Manual or Auto   | You can enable auto-rotation (1 year) |
| Imported Keys         | ‚ùå Manual only      | You must rotate them yourself         |

---

## üåç Regional Scope

* KMS keys are **region-scoped**. They do **not replicate across regions**.
* If copying encrypted data to another region (e.g., EBS snapshot), you must:

  1. Create a snapshot (encrypted with Region A key)
  2. Copy it to Region B with a new Region B KMS key
  3. Create a volume from the re-encrypted snapshot

> You **can‚Äôt use the same KMS key in multiple regions**.

---

## üîê KMS Key Policies

KMS access is controlled using **Key Policies** (like S3 bucket policies):

### 1. **Default Key Policy**

* Created automatically
* Grants access to the full account (`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root`)
* IAM permissions still required

### 2. **Custom Key Policy**

* You define **explicit users/roles** that can use/administer the key
* Required for **cross-account access**

> If no key policy exists, **nobody** can access the key‚Äîeven the root user.

---

## üîç Auditing and Monitoring

* **Every API call to KMS** (Encrypt, Decrypt, CreateKey, etc.) is **logged in CloudTrail**
* You can filter, analyze, and alert based on this data
* KMS is **designed for full compliance and governance visibility**

---

## üí° Example: Cross-Account Encrypted Snapshot Sharing


* Account A creates an EBS snapshot encrypted with a **Customer-Managed Key (CMK)**.
* Account A **adds KMS key policy** to allow **Account B** (`kms:Decrypt`, `kms:ReEncrypt*`, `kms:DescribeKey`).
* Account A **shares** the encrypted snapshot with Account B (via snapshot permissions).
* Account B **copies** the snapshot to its own account, decrypts using Account A's CMK, and **re-encrypts it** using its own(Account B's) CMK.
* Account B creates a new EBS volume from the **copied (re-encrypted)** snapshot.

## ‚úÖ Final Revision Sheet

| Topic                       | Summary                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **KMS Purpose**             | Key lifecycle mgmt + secure encryption      |
| **Symmetric vs Asymmetric** | Symmetric = 1 key, Asymmetric = key pair    |
| **Key Categories**          | AWS-Owned, AWS-Managed, Customer-Managed    |
| **Pricing**                 | Customer key: \$1/mo + \$0.03 per 10K calls |
| **Key Rotation**            | AWS-Managed = Auto; Customer = Configurable |
| **Regional Scope**          | Keys are region-specific                    |
| **Access Control**          | IAM + KMS key policy (both required)        |
| **Audit Logging**           | Full logging in CloudTrail                  |
| **Integration**             | Native to 90%+ AWS services                 |
